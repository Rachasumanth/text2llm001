{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "4269567", "title": "Dog", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "content_length": 51276, "text": "The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of wolves. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. Dogs and the modern gray wolf share a common ancestor. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated over 14,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture, though genetic studies suggest the domestication process may have begun over 25,000 years ago. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.\nDogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.\nCommunication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and chemical communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. As such, the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of \"man's best friend\".\nThe global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. Developed countries make up approximately 20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in the form of feral and street dogs.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nDogs are domesticated members of the family Canidae. They are classified as a subspecies of Canis lupus, along with wolves and dingoes. Genetic studies show that dogs likely diverged from wolves between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago. Dogs were domesticated from wolves at least 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, before the development of agriculture; the remains of the Bonn–Oberkassel dog, buried alongside humans between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, are the earliest to be conclusively identified as a domesticated dog.  The dingo and the related New Guinea singing dog resulted from the geographic isolation and feralization of dogs in Oceania over 8,000 years ago.\nDogs, wolves, and dingoes have sometimes been classified as separate species. In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus assigned the genus name Canis (which is the Latin word for \"dog\") to the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal in his book, Systema Naturae. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus. Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata in Latin term), which is not found in any other canid. In the 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World, mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed the wolf as a wild subspecies of Canis lupus and proposed two additional subspecies: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus in 1758, and dingo, named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior synonym) for the dingo. This classification was informed by a 1999 mitochondrial DNA study.\nThe classification of dingoes is disputed and a political issue in Australia. Classifying dingoes as wild dogs simplifies reducing or controlling dingo populations that threaten livestock. Treating dingoes as a separate species allows conservation programs to protect the dingo population. Dingo classification affects wildlife management policies, legislation, and societal attitudes. In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog to be feral Canis familiaris. Therefore, it did not assess them for the IUCN Red List of threatened species.\n\n\n=== Domestication ===\n\nThe earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf. Dated to 14,223 years ago, the dog was found buried along with a man and a woman; all three had been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had survived canine distemper as a puppy - survival without intensive human care is unlikely, and occurred at an age before the dog could have had any utilitarian use. This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated during the hunter-gatherer era, predating agriculture. Earlier remains dating back 30,000 years have been described as Paleolithic dogs, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late Pleistocene.\nDNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population that was distinct from any modern wolf lineage. Some studies have posited that all living wolves are more closely related to each other than to dogs, while others have suggested that dogs are more closely related to modern Eurasian wolves than to American wolves.\nThe dog is a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into domestication (i.e. humans initially neither benefitted nor were harmed by wild dogs eating refuse from their camps). The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated remains uncertain. Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia. In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia, with dogs likely accompanying the first humans to inhabit the Americas. Some studies have suggested that the extinct Japanese wolf is closely related to the ancestor of domestic dogs.\nIn 2018, a study identified 429 genes that differed between modern dogs and modern wolves. As the differences in these genes could also be found in ancient dog fossils, these were regarded as being the result of the initial domestication and not from recent breed formation. These genes are linked to neural crest and central nervous system development. These genes affect embryogenesis and can confer tameness, smaller jaws, floppy ears, and diminished craniofacial development, which distinguish domesticated dogs from wolves and are considered to reflect domestication syndrome. The study concluded that during early dog domestication, the initial selection was for behavior. This trait is influenced by those genes which act in the neural crest, which led to the phenotypes observed in modern dogs.\n\n\n=== Breeds ===\n\n There are around 450 official dog breeds, the most of any mammal. Dogs began diversifying in the Victorian era, when humans took control of their natural selection. Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years. Since then, dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and have been subjected to artificial selection by humans. The skull, body, and limb proportions between breeds display more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type, and colour. As such, humans have long used dogs for their desirable traits to complete or fulfill a certain work or role. Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, hunting, retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression. Present-day dogs are dispersed around the world. An example of this dispersal is the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the Victorian era.\n\n\n== Anatomy and physiology ==\n\n\n=== Size and skeleton ===\n\nDogs are extremely variable in size, ranging from one of the largest breeds, the Great Dane, at 50–79 kg (110–174 lb) and 71–81 cm (28–32 in), to one of the smallest, the Chihuahua, at 0.5–3 kg (1.1–6.6 lb) and 13–20 cm (5.1–7.9 in). All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types. The dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for back muscles, consisting of epaxial muscles and hypaxial muscles, to connect to; the long ribs provide room for the heart and lungs; and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton, allowing for flexibility.\nCompared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's skeleton increase in size for larger types such as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as terriers; dwarfism has been selectively bred for some types where short legs are preferred, such as dachshunds and corgis. Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally short tails have as few as three.\n\nThe dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence in terms of skull shape between types. The three basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as seen in sighthounds, the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls. The jaw contains around 42 teeth, and it has evolved for the consumption of flesh. Dogs use their carnassial teeth to cut food into bite-sized chunks, more especially meat.\n\n\n=== Senses ===\n\nDogs' senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and magnetoreception. One study suggests that dogs can feel small variations in Earth's magnetic field. Dogs prefer to defecate with their spines aligned in a north–south position in calm magnetic field conditions.\nDogs' vision is dichromatic; their visual world consists of yellows, blues, and grays. They have difficulty differentiating between red and green, and much like other mammals, the dog's eye is composed of two types of cone cells compared to the human's three. The divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12 to 25°, depending on the breed, which can have different retina configurations. The fovea centralis area of the eye is attached to a nerve fiber, and is the most sensitive to photons. Additionally, a study found that dogs' visual acuity was up to eight times less effective than a human, and their ability to discriminate levels of brightness was about two times worse than a human.\nWhile the human brain is dominated by a large visual cortex, the dog brain is dominated by a large olfactory cortex. Dogs have roughly forty times more smell-sensitive receptors than humans, ranging from about 125 million to nearly 300 million in some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds. This sense of smell is the most prominent sense of the species; it detects chemical changes in the environment, allowing dogs to pinpoint the location of mating partners, potential stressors, resources, etc. Dogs also have an acute sense of hearing up to four times greater than that of humans. They can pick up the slightest sounds from about 400 m (1,300 ft) compared to 90 m (300 ft) for humans.\nDogs have stiff, deeply embedded hairs known as whiskers that sense atmospheric changes, vibrations, and objects not visible in low light conditions. The lower most part of whiskers hold more receptor cells than other hair types, which help in alerting dogs of objects that could collide with the nose, ears, and jaw. Whiskers likely also facilitate the movement of food towards the mouth.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: \"double\" being common in dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or \"single\", with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional \"blaze\", stripe, or \"star\" of white fur on their chest or underside. Premature graying can occur in dogs as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, and fear of unfamiliar noise, people, or animals. Some dog breeds are hairless, while others have a very thick corded coat. The coats of certain breeds are often groomed to a characteristic style, for example, the Yorkshire Terrier's \"show cut\".\n\n\n=== Dewclaw ===\nA dog's dewclaw is the fifth digit in its forelimb and hind legs. Dewclaws on the forelimbs are attached by bone and ligament, while the dewclaws on the hind legs are attached only by skin. Most dogs are not born with dewclaws in their hind legs, and some are without them in their forelimbs. Dogs' dewclaws consist of the proximal phalanges and distal phalanges. Some publications theorize that dewclaws in wolves, who usually do not have dewclaws, were a sign of hybridization with dogs.\n\n\n=== Tail ===\nA dog's tail is the terminal appendage of the vertebral column, which is made up of a string of 5 to 23 vertebrae enclosed in muscles and skin that support the dog's back extensor muscles. One of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state. The tail also helps the dog maintain balance by putting its weight on the opposite side of the dog's tilt, and it can also help the dog spread its anal gland's scent through the tail's position and movement. Dogs can have a violet gland (or supracaudal gland) characterized by sebaceous glands on the dorsal surface of their tails; in some breeds, it may be vestigial or absent. The enlargement of the violet gland in the tail, which can create a bald spot from hair loss, can be caused by Cushing's disease or an excess of sebum from androgens in the sebaceous glands.\n\nA study suggests that dogs show asymmetric tail-wagging responses to different emotive stimuli. \"Stimuli that could be expected to elicit approach tendencies seem to be associated with [a] higher amplitude of tail-wagging movements to the right side\". Dogs can injure themselves by wagging their tails forcefully; this condition is called kennel tail, happy tail, bleeding tail, or splitting tail. In some hunting dogs, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries. Some dogs can be born without tails because of a DNA variant in the T gene, which can also result in a congenitally short (bobtail) tail. Tail docking is opposed by many veterinary and animal welfare organisations such as the American Veterinary Medical Association and the British Veterinary Association. Evidence from veterinary practices and questionnaires showed that around 500 dogs would need to have their tail docked to prevent one injury.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nNumerous disorders have been known to affect dogs. Some are congenital and others are acquired. Dogs can acquire upper respiratory tract diseases including diseases that affect the nasal cavity, the larynx, and the trachea; lower respiratory tract diseases which includes pulmonary disease and acute respiratory diseases; heart diseases which includes any cardiovascular inflammation or dysfunction of the heart; haemopoietic diseases including anaemia and clotting disorders; gastrointestinal disease such as diarrhoea and gastric dilatation volvulus; hepatic disease such as portosystemic shunts and liver failure; pancreatic disease such as pancreatitis; renal disease; lower urinary tract disease such as cystitis and urolithiasis; endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus, Cushing's syndrome, hypoadrenocorticism, and hypothyroidism; nervous system diseases such as seizures and spinal injury; musculoskeletal disease such as arthritis and myopathies; dermatological disorders such as alopecia and pyoderma; ophthalmological diseases such as conjunctivitis, glaucoma, entropion, and progressive retinal atrophy; and neoplasia.\nCommon dog parasites are lice, fleas, fly larvae, ticks, mites, cestodes, nematodes, and coccidia. Taenia is a notable genus with 5 species in which dogs are the definitive host. Additionally, dogs are a source of zoonoses for humans. They are responsible for 99% of rabies cases worldwide; however, in some developed countries such as the UK, rabies is absent from dogs and is instead only transmitted by bats. Other common zoonoses are hydatid disease, leptospirosis, pasteurellosis, ringworm, and toxocariasis. Common infections in dogs include canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, leptospirosis, canine influenza, and canine coronavirus. All of these conditions have vaccines available.\nDogs are the companion animal most frequently reported for exposure to toxins. Most poisonings are accidental; in the US more than 80% of reports of exposure to the ASPCA animal poisoning hotline are due to oral exposure. The most common substances people report exposure to are: pharmaceuticals, toxic foods, and rodenticides. Data from the Pet Poison Helpline shows that human drugs are the most frequent cause of toxicosis death. The most common household products ingested are cleaning products. Most food related poisonings involved theobromine poisoning (chocolate). Other common food poisonings include xylitol, Vitis (grapes, raisins, etc.), and Allium (garlic, onions, etc.). Pyrethrin insecticides were the most common cause of pesticide poisoning. Metaldehyde, a common pesticide for snails and slugs, typically causes severe outcomes when ingested by dogs.\nNeoplasia is the most common cause of death for dogs. Other common causes of death are heart and renal failure. Their pathology is similar to that of humans, as is their response to treatment and their outcomes. Genes found in humans to be responsible for disorders are investigated in dogs as being the cause and vice versa.\n\n\n=== Lifespan ===\n\nThe typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but the median longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) is about 12.7 years. Obesity correlates negatively with longevity with one study finding obese dogs to have a life expectancy approximately a year and a half less than dogs with a healthy weight.\nA 2024 UK study analyzing 584,734 dogs concluded that purebred dogs live longer than crossbred dogs, challenging the previous notion of the latter having the higher life expectancies. The authors noted that their study included \"designer dogs\" as crossbred and that purebred dogs were typically given better care than their crossbred counterparts, which likely influenced the outcome of the study. Other studies also show that fully mongrel dogs live about a year longer on average than dogs with pedigrees. Furthermore, small dogs with longer muzzles have been shown to have higher lifespans than larger medium-sized dogs with much more depressed muzzles. For free-ranging dogs, less than 1 in 5 reach sexual maturity, and the median life expectancy for feral dogs is less than half of dogs living with humans.\n\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n\nIn domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six months to one year for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age in some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle, characterized by their vulvas swelling and producing discharges, usually lasting between 4 and 20 days. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will become estrous, mentally and physically receptive to copulation. Because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the same litter. Fertilization typically occurs two to five days after ovulation. After ejaculation, the dogs are coitally tied for around 5–30 minutes because of the male's bulbus glandis swelling and the female's constrictor vestibuli contracting; the male will continue ejaculating until they untie naturally due to muscle relaxation. 14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after seven to eight more days, a heartbeat is detectable. Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization, with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six puppies.\n\n\n==== Neutering ====\nNeutering is the sterilization of animals via gonadectomy, which is an orchidectomy (castration) in dogs and ovariohysterectomy (spay) in bitches. Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs. Spayed females are less likely to develop cancers affecting the mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs. However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence and pyometra in bitches, prostate cancer in dogs, and osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.\nNeutering is the most common surgical procedure in dogs less than a year old in the US and is seen as a control method for overpopulation. Neutering often occurs as early as 6–14 weeks in shelters in the US. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) advises that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanized. However, the Society for Theriogenology and the American College of Theriogenologists made a joint statement that opposes mandatory neutering; they said that the cause of overpopulation in the US is cultural.\nNeutering is less common in most European countries, especially in Nordic countries—except for the UK, where it is common. In Norway neutering is illegal unless for the benefit of the animal's health (e.g., ovariohysterectomy in case of ovarian or uterine neoplasia). Some European countries have similar laws to Norway, but their wording either explicitly allows for neutering for controlling reproduction or it is allowed in practice or by contradiction through other laws. Italy and Portugal have passed recent laws that promote it. Germany forbids early-age neutering, but neutering is still allowed at the usual age. In Romania neutering is mandatory except for when a pedigree to select breeds can be shown.\n\n\n==== Inbreeding depression ====\n\nA common breeding practice for pet dogs is to mate them between close relatives (e.g., between half- and full-siblings). In a study of seven dog breeds (the Bernese Mountain Dog, Basset Hound, Cairn Terrier, Brittany, German Shepherd Dog, Leonberger, and West Highland White Terrier), it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival. Another analysis of data on 42,855 Dachshund litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression. In a study of Boxer litters, 22% of puppies died before reaching 7 weeks of age. Stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection. Mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding.\n\n\n== Behavior ==\n\nDog behavior has been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. They have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and are uniquely attuned to human behaviors. Behavioral scientists suggest that a set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs that are not possessed by the dog's canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great apes, are parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.  Dogs have about twice the number of neurons in their cerebral cortexes than what cats have, which suggests they could be about twice as intelligent.\n\nMost domestic animals were initially bred for the production of goods. Dogs, on the other hand, were selectively bred for desirable behavioral traits. In 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations indicate the occurrence of artificial selection and the subsequent divergence of behavior and anatomical features. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e., selection for tameness) and emotional processing. Compared to their wolf counterparts, dogs tend to be less timid and less aggressive, though some of these genes have been associated with aggression in certain dog breeds. Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem-solving ability. In a 2023 study of 58 dogs, some dogs classified as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-like showed lower serotonin and dopamine concentrations. A similar study claims that hyperactivity is more common in male and young dogs. A dog can become aggressive because of trauma or abuse, fear or anxiety, territorial protection, or protecting an item it considers valuable. Acute stress reactions from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) seen in dogs can evolve into chronic stress. Police dogs with PTSD can often refuse to work.\nDogs have a natural instinct called prey drive (the term is chiefly used to describe training dogs' habits) which can be influenced by breeding. These instincts can drive dogs to consider objects or other animals to be prey or drive possessive behavior. These traits have been enhanced in some breeds so that they may be used to hunt and kill vermin or other pests. Puppies or dogs sometimes bury food underground. One study found that wolves outperformed dogs in finding food caches, likely due to a \"difference in motivation\" between wolves and dogs. Some puppies and dogs engage in coprophagy out of habit, stress, for attention, or boredom; most of them will not do it later in life. A study hypothesizes that the behavior was inherited from wolves, a behavior likely evolved to lessen the presence of intestinal parasites in dens. Most dogs can swim. In a study of 412 dogs, around 36.5% of the dogs could not swim; the other 63.5% were able to swim without a trainer in a swimming pool. A study of 55 dogs found a correlation between swimming and 'improvement' of the hip osteoarthritis joint.\n\n\n=== Nursing ===\n\nThe female dog (bitch) may produce colostrum, a type of milk high in nutrients and antibodies, 1–7 days before giving birth. Milk production lasts for around three months, and increases with litter size. The dog can sometimes vomit and refuse food during child contractions. In the later stages of the dog's pregnancy, nesting behaviour may occur. Puppies are born with a protective fetal membrane that the mother usually removes shortly after birth. Dogs can have the maternal instincts to start grooming their puppies, consume their puppies' feces, and protect their puppies, likely due to their hormonal state. While male-parent dogs can show more disinterested behaviour toward their own puppies, most can play with the young pups as they would with other dogs or humans. A bitch may abandon or attack her puppies or her male partner dog if she is stressed or in pain.\n\n\n=== Intelligence ===\n\nResearchers have tested dogs' ability to perceive information, retain it as knowledge, and apply it to solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference. A study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items after four weeks of the initial exposure. A study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented that he had learned the names and could associate them by verbal command with over 1,000 words.\nOne study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are similar to those of horses, chimpanzees, or cats. One study of 18 household dogs found that the dogs could not distinguish food bowls at specific locations without distinguishing cues; the study stated that this indicates a lack of spatial memory. A study stated that dogs have a visual sense for number. The dogs showed a ratio-dependent activation both for numerical values from 1–3 to larger than four.\nDogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. Another experimental study showed evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans. Another study showed that dogs stared at humans after failing to complete an impossible version of the same task they had been trained to solve. Wolves, under the same situation, avoided staring at humans altogether.\n\n\n=== Communication ===\n\nDog communication is the transfer of information between dogs, as well as between dogs and humans. Communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). Dogs mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Both sexes of dogs may also urinate to communicate anxiety or frustration, submissiveness, or when in exciting or relaxing situations. Overarousal in dogs can be a result of the dogs' higher cortisol levels. Dogs begin socializing with other dogs by the time they reach the ages of 3 to 8 weeks, and at about 5 to 12 weeks of age, they alter their focus from dogs to humans. Belly exposure in dogs can be a defensive behavior that can lead to a bite or to seek comfort.\nHumans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture. With their acute sense of hearing, dogs rely on the auditory aspect of communication for understanding and responding to various cues, including the distinctive barking patterns that convey different messages. A study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that dogs respond to both vocal and nonvocal voices using the brain's region towards the temporal pole, similar to that of humans' brains. Most dogs also looked significantly longer at the face whose expression matched the valence of vocalization. A study of caudate responses shows that dogs tend to respond more positively to social rewards than to food rewards.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe dog is the most widely abundant large carnivoran living in the human environment. In 2020, the estimated global dog population was between 700 million and 1 billion. In the same year, a study found the dog to be the most popular pet in the United States, as they were present in 34 out of every 100 homes. About 20% of the dog population live in developed countries. In the developing world, it was estimated as of 2001 that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs. Most of these dogs live as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing that village dogs' most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%).\n\n\n=== Competitors ===\nFeral and free-ranging dogs' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans. Although wolves are known to kill dogs, wolves tend to live in pairs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage when facing large dog groups. In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed. Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, there is still a fear among humans of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs, and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.\nCoyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. In particular, leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter their size. Siberian tigers in the Amur river region have killed dogs in the middle of villages. They will not tolerate wolves as competitors within their territories, and the tigers could be considering dogs in the same way. Striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in their range. Dogs as introduced predators have affected the ecology of New Zealand, which lacked indigenous land-based mammals before human settlement. Dogs have made 11 vertebrate species extinct and are identified as a 'potential threat' to at least 188 threatened species worldwide. Dogs have also been linked to the extinction of 156 animal species. Dogs have been documented to have killed a few birds of the endangered species, the kagu, in New Caledonia.\n\n\n=== Diet ===\n\nDogs are typically described as omnivores. Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet. Similar to humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva and are classified as having a high-starch diet. Despite being an omnivore, dogs are only able to conjugate bile acid with taurine. They must get vitamin D from their diet.\nOf the twenty-one amino acids common to all life forms (including selenocysteine), dogs cannot synthesize ten: arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain nitrogen balance. These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores.\n\n\n=== Range ===\nAs a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog has notable exceptions of presence in:\n\nThe Aboriginal Tasmanians, who were separated from Australia before the arrival of dingos on that continent\nThe Andamanese peoples, who were isolated when rising sea levels covered the land bridge to Myanmar\nThe Fuegians, who instead domesticated the Fuegian dog, an already extinct different canid species\nIndividual Pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs or where the dogs died out after original settlement, notably the Mariana Islands, Palau and most of the Caroline Islands with exceptions such as Fais Island and Nukuoro, the Marshall Islands, the Gilbert Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Tonga, Marquesas, Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Rapa Iti in French Polynesia, Easter Island, the Chatham Islands, and Pitcairn Island (settled by the Bounty mutineers, who killed off their dogs to escape discovery by passing ships).\nDogs were introduced to Antarctica as sled dogs. Starting practice in December 1993, dogs were later outlawed by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty international agreement due to the possible risk of spreading infections.\n\n\n== Roles with humans ==\n\nThe domesticated dog originated as a predator and scavenger. They inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for dogs' trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and probably also their co-existence with early human hunter-gatherers. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, and aiding disabled individuals. These roles in human society have earned them the nickname \"man's best friend\" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat.\n\n\n=== Pets ===\n\nThe keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history. Pet-dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased. In the 1980s, there have been changes in the pet dog's functions, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians. Within the second half of the 20th century, more and more dog owners considered their animal to be a part of the family. This major social status shift allowed the dog to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior. The second has been the broadening of the concepts of family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.\nProducts such as dog-training books, classes, and television programs target dog owners. Some dog-trainers have promoted a dominance model of dog-human relationships. However, the idea of the \"alpha dog\" trying to be dominant is based on a controversial theory about wolf packs. It has been disputed that \"trying to achieve status\" is characteristic of dog-human interactions. Human family members have increased participation in activities in which the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga.\nAccording to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the United States have pet dogs. The source shows that nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% own two dogs, and nearly 9% own more than two dogs. The data also shows an equal number of male and female pet dogs; less than one-fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters.\n\n\n=== Workers ===\nIn addition to dogs' role as companion animals, dogs have been bred for herding livestock (such as collies and sheepdogs); for hunting; for rodent control (such as terriers); as search and rescue dogs; as detection dogs (such as those trained to detect illicit drugs or chemical weapons); as homeguard dogs; as police dogs (sometimes nicknamed \"K-9\"); as welfare-purpose dogs; as dogs who assist fishermen retrieve their nets; and as dogs that pull loads (such as sled dogs). In 1957, the dog Laika became one of the first animals to be launched into Earth orbit aboard the Soviets's Sputnik 2; Laika died during the flight from overheating. Various kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs, including guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance dogs, and psychiatric service dogs, assist individuals with disabilities. A study of 29 dogs found that 9 dogs owned by people with epilepsy were reported to exhibit attention-getting behavior to their handler 30 seconds to 45 minutes prior to an impending seizure; there was no significant correlation between the patients' demographics, health, or attitude towards their pets.\n\n\n=== Shows and sports ===\n\nDogs compete in breed-conformation shows and dog sports (including racing, sledding, and agility competitions). In dog shows, also referred to as \"breed shows\", a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in a breed standard. Weight pulling, a dog sport involving pulling weight, has been criticized for promoting doping and for its risk of injury.\n\n\n=== Dogs as food ===\n\nHumans have consumed dog meat going back at least 14,000 years. It is unknown to what extent prehistoric dogs were consumed and bred for meat. For centuries, the practice was prevalent in Southeast Asia, East Asia, Africa, and Oceania before cultural changes triggered by the spread of religions resulted in dog meat consumption declining and becoming more taboo. Switzerland, Polynesia, and pre-Columbian Mexico historically consumed dog meat. Some Native American dogs, like the Peruvian Hairless Dog and Xoloitzcuintle, were raised to be sacrificed and eaten. Han Chinese traditionally ate dogs. Consumption of dog meat declined but did not end during the Sui dynasty (581–618) and Tang dynasty (618–907) due in part to the spread of Buddhism and the upper class rejecting the practice. Dog consumption was rare in India, Iran, and Europe.\nEating dog meat is a social taboo in most parts of the world, though some still consume it in modern times. It is still consumed in some East Asian countries, including China, Vietnam, Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines. An estimated 30 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year. China is the world's largest consumer of dogs, with an estimated 10 to 20 million dogs killed every year for human consumption. In Vietnam, about 5 million dogs are slaughtered annually. In 2024, China, Singapore, and Thailand placed a ban on the consumption of dogs within their borders. In some parts of Poland and Central Asia, dog fat is reportedly believed to be beneficial for the lungs. Proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is Western hypocrisy and that there is no difference in eating different animals' meat.\nThere is a long history of dog meat consumption in South Korea, but the practice has fallen out of favor. A 2017 survey found that under 40% of participants supported a ban on the distribution and consumption of dog meat. This increased to over 50% in 2020, suggesting changing attitudes, particularly among younger individuals. In 2018, the South Korean government passed a bill banning restaurants that sell dog meat from doing so during that year's Winter Olympics. On 9 January 2024, the South Korean parliament passed a law banning the distribution and sale of dog meat. It will take effect in 2027, with plans to assist dog farmers in transitioning to other products. The primary type of dog raised for meat in South Korea has been the Nureongi. In North Korea where meat is scarce, eating dog is a common and accepted practice, officially promoted by the government.\n\n\n=== Health risks ===\n\nIn 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 59,000 people died globally from rabies, with 59.6% of the deaths in Asia and 36.4% in Africa. Rabies is a disease for which dogs are the most significant vector. Dog bites affect tens of millions of people globally each year. The primary victims of dog bite incidents are children. They are more likely to sustain more serious injuries from bites, which can lead to death. Sharp claws can lacerate flesh and cause serious infections. In the United States, cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year. It has been estimated that around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in U.K. hospitals are domestic accidents. The same study concluded that dog-associated road accidents involving injuries more commonly involve two-wheeled vehicles. Some countries and cities have also banned or restricted certain dog breeds, usually for safety concerns.\nToxocara canis (dog roundworm) eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis. It is estimated that nearly 14% of people in the United States are infected with Toxocara; about 10,000 cases are reported each year. Untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision. Dog feces can also contain hookworms that cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans.\n\n\n=== Health benefits ===\n\nThe scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's companionship can enhance human physical and psychological well-being. Studies suggest that there are benefits to physical health and psychological well-being, but they have been criticized for being \"poorly controlled\". One study states that \"the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal\". Earlier studies have shown that pet-dog or -cat guardians make fewer hospital visits and are less likely to be on medication for heart problems and sleeping difficulties than non-guardians. People with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats or those without pets; these effects are relatively long-term. Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased survival in cases of coronary artery disease. Human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who do not own dogs. Studies have found a small to moderate correlation between dog-ownership and increased adult physical-activity levels.\n\nA 2005 paper by the British Medical Journal states: Recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets. Health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in a pet dog's presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety and are exposed to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases (according to the hygiene hypothesis). Other benefits include dogs as social support.\nOne study indicated that wheelchair-users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they are not. In a 2015 study, it was found that having a pet made people more inclined to foster positive relationships with their neighbors. In one study, new guardians reported a significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition, which was sustained through the 10-month study.\nUsing dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late-18th century, when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders. Animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase smiling and laughing among people with Alzheimer's disease. One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, knowledge, and skill-objectives and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those not in an animal-assisted program.\n\n\n=== Cultural importance ===\n\nArtworks have depicted dogs as symbols of guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, alertness, and love. In ancient Mesopotamia, from the Old Babylonian period until the Neo-Babylonian period, dogs were the symbol of Ninisina, the goddess of healing and medicine, and her worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her. In the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, dogs served as emblems of magical protection. In China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.\nIn mythology, dogs often appear as pets or as watchdogs. Stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout Indo-European mythologies and may originate from Proto-Indo-European traditions. In Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed, dragon-tailed watchdog who guards the gates of Hades. Dogs also feature in association with the Greek goddess Hecate. In Norse mythology, a dog called Garmr guards Hel, a realm of the dead. In Persian mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge. In Welsh mythology, Cŵn Annwn guards Annwn. In Hindu mythology, Yama, the god of death, owns two watchdogs named Shyama and Sharvara, which each have four eyes—they are said to watch over the gates of Naraka. A black dog is considered to be the vahana (vehicle) of Bhairava (an incarnation of Shiva).\nIn Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness. Within the Roman Catholic denomination specifically, the iconography of Saint Dominic includes a dog after the saint's mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and became pregnant shortly after that. As such, the Dominican Order (Ecclesiastical Latin: Domini canis) means \"dog of the Lord\" or \"hound of the Lord\". In Christian folklore, a church grim often takes the form of a black dog to guard Christian churches and their churchyards from sacrilege. Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets but requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves and to make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them. The view on dogs in Islam is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing them as unclean, although Khaled Abou El Fadl states that this view is based on \"pre-Islamic Arab mythology\" and \"a tradition [...] falsely attributed to the Prophet\". The Sunni Maliki school jurists disagree with the idea that dogs are unclean.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nDog – the species (or subspecies) as a whole, also any male member of the same.\nBitch – any female member of the species (or subspecies).\nPuppy or pup – a young member of the species (or subspecies) under 12 months old.\nSire – the male parent of a litter.\nDam – the female parent of a litter.\nLitter – all of the puppies resulting from a single whelping.\nWhelping – the act of a bitch giving birth.\nWhelps – puppies still dependent upon their dam.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dog breeds\nList of individual dogs\nList of canids\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBoitani L, Mech LD (2003).

{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "868125", "title": "Heartbeat (British TV series)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_(British_TV_series)", "content_length": 15943, "text": "Heartbeat is a British police procedural period drama series, based upon the Constable series of novels written by Nicholas Rhea, and produced by Yorkshire Television until it was merged with ITV, then by ITV Studios, from 1992 until 2010. The series is set in the North Riding of Yorkshire during the 1960s, with plots centred on the fictional locations of Aidensfield and Ashfordly. \nThe programme initially starred Nick Berry, Niamh Cusack, Derek Fowlds, William Simons, Mark Jordon and Bill Maynard, but as more main characters were added to the series, additional actors included Jason Durr, Jonathan Kerrigan, Philip Franks, Duncan Bell, Clare Wille, Lisa Kay, Tricia Penrose, Geoffrey Hughes, Peter Benson and Gwen Taylor. Fowlds as Oscar Blaketon and Simons as Alf Ventress were the only actors to be in the programme for its entire 18 series run. Production of episodes involved filming of outdoor and exterior scenes around the North Riding, including in and around Whitby and Goathland, with interior scenes filmed at The Leeds Studios.\nHeartbeat proved popular from the beginning, when early series consistently drew over 10 million viewers, achieving a peak audience of 13.82 million in 2001, and 12.8 million viewers in 2003. Its success eventually led to a spin-off series, titled The Royal, as well as a special episode, and three documentaries. In June 2010, ITV announced the cancellation of Heartbeat after its eighteenth series, following discussions on its future.\n\n\n== Premise ==\n\nHeartbeat is a period drama set within the North Riding of Yorkshire during the 1960s. Plots for each episode are centred around the fictional locations of Aidensfield and Ashfordly, occasionally including the real town of Whitby. Some episodes featured references to the counterculture movement of the 1960s.\nThe programme's title was chosen by writers to represent the series' key characters who worked as police officers and medical staff  –  \"heart\" for the medical themes featured regularly in the programme, and \"beat\" for a policeman's \"beat\" or area that he patrols. Each episode's set of storylines were inspired by those of the Constable series of books, written by Nicholas Rhea (the pen-name of former policeman Peter Walker), which were focused on a police constable in the 1960s who came to Aidensfield. Many of the characters and locations in the Constable series were used for creating the setting and plots in Heartbeat, under guidance from Rhea.\nThe series was originally intended as a launch platform for actor Nick Berry, following his involvement on the BBC's soap opera EastEnders. Berry and actress Niamh Cusack were the prominent main actors of the programme for its first two series. Storylines mainly focused around both their characters, as they offered aid to those around the village and beyond, though the tone of plots was portrayed with grittiness and social realism. From the third series onwards, the role of the village policeman continued to be central to the storyline, but supporting actors were redefined as the programme's main cast, with their characters elevated in presence, effectively developing Heartbeat into an ensemble drama that was themed as more cosy and comfortable compared to more modern TV police dramas. The changes were more notable by how supporting actors gained more prominence in the opening titles after being elevated into the series' main cast  –  up until the fifth series, both Berry and Cusack were prominently featured in the opening credits, but this changed in later series so that by the beginning of the seventh series, all actors in the main cast were given credit for their involvement.\nAfter the fifth series, storylines became less centralized around the village constable, focusing on separate storylines that retained a set structure within episodes: one focusing on a crime solved by the village constable and his colleagues at Ashfordly police; one focused on a medical issue that the village doctor and/or nurse would treat; and a side story focused on the programme's \"lovable rogue\" character which mainly was designed as comic relief, but sometimes featured light-hearted plots. In addition, over-arching storylines covering several episodes or even series, provided sub-plots between main characters, allowing for character and relationship development between them, with additional characters added in over time. In time, Heartbeat saw the cast being changed throughout its broadcast history, as new characters were introduced to replace those who left the show.\nSixties pop music features prominently in episodes, notably from the Beatles and Chuck Berry, forming the backbone of Heartbeat's soundtrack, although music from other decades sometimes is played in episodes. \nSome 1970s records appear anachronistically, such as the Hollies' 1974 song \"The Air That I Breathe\", Led Zeppelin's \"Black Dog\" (1971), Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\" (1974) or Pink Floyd's 1971 instrumental \"One of These Days\". The end scene of the series 17 episode \"You Never Can Tell\" is accompanied by the Flying Pickets' 1983 song \"Only You\", an episode which featured a guest appearance by the band's lead singer Brian Hibbard.\nAlthough Heartbeat was broadcast over 18 years from 1992 to 2010, the show remained set in the 1960s throughout its entire run. Series 1, which broadcast in 1992, was set in 1965, with PC Rowan referring to, in the first episode, the Clacton riots of 1964 being \"last year\" whilst attempting to dissuade a young rocker from taking part in a potential 'Mods and Rockers' conflict in the village. By roughly Series 8, Heartbeat had reached 1969, and yet the show seemingly remained set in 1969 until the end of Series 18's broadcast in 2010, never moving into the 1970s. The episode titled \"One Small Step\", which was the 21st episode of Series 16, took place at the time of the July 1969 Apollo 11 moon landings.\nHeartbeat had five main stars over the course of its 18 series run, i.e. Nick Berry as Nick Rowan (Series 1–7, 1992–1998), Jason Durr as Mike Bradley (Series 7–12, 1997–2003), James Carlton as Steve Crane (Series 12–13, 2003–2004), Jonathan Kerrigan as Rob Walker (Series 14–16, 2004–2007), and Joe McFadden as Joe Mason (Series 17–18, 2007–2010).\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n=== Special programmes ===\nThe following is a list of specials made for Heartbeat, most of which were behind-the-scene documentaries. All were later included in DVD boxsets for specific series of the programme:\n\nHeartbeat: Changing Places (13 June 1999) – A one-off special, starring Nick Berry and Juliette Gruber, who reprised their roles as Nick and Jo Rowan respectively. This extended episode was initially released on VHS in 1998, before its television debut over a year later. It focused on life for the Rowans after they move to Canada, including Nick's new job as a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The episode was filmed on location in Cochrane, Alberta, which is around 22 miles from the city of Calgary. In Cochrane, Nick discovers a lot of similarities to what he had in Aidensfield, such as a police boss like Blaketon and a female lovable rogue who is similar to Greengrass. There are also differences, such as the need to use guns in the line of duty, the presence of First Nations people, and the different animals that roam the countryside and bins, such as bears and moose.\n10 Years of Heartbeat (14 April 2002): A documentary special to celebrate the programme's tenth anniversary. Past and present members of the cast and crew, along with celebrity guests, recalled their experiences of the show and reviewed their favourite moments from the previous ten years.\nHeartbeat: Christmas Album (18 December 2005): A special that looked back at the Christmas episodes created for Heartbeat.\nHeartbeat: Farewell Phil (24 December 2007): A one-off special, commemorating the departure of actor Mark Jordon from the programme, after performing for seventeen series as the character Phil Bellamy. Both the actor and his former colleagues relive moments from the series featuring Jordon's character.\nIn August 2023, the TV Heartbeat Podcast was announced. An 8 part series that will be released weekly on the YouTube channel @TVHeartbeat and will delve into all things Heartbeat with conversations with cast, writers and fans. It is the accompanying podcast to the fan pages on Twitter @TVHeartbeat and Instagram TV.Heartbeat\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nThe series was filmed at various locations around North Yorkshire. These include shots on the moors and frequent mentions of local roads (like the A171). Exterior scenes of Aidensfield are filmed in the village of Goathland in North Yorkshire, with the village's railway station also appearing occasionally. Other prominent filming locations include Whitby, Otley and Scarborough. The \"Heartbeat: Changing Places\" special includes location filming in Canada and in series 18, two episodes were filmed on location in Queensland, Australia.\n\n\n== Broadcast ==\nWhen Heartbeat first began on 10 April 1992 it aired on Fridays at 9.00 pm (on the ITV Network) but from series 2 it was moved to Sunday evenings in the 7.00 pm or 8.00 pm timeslot. All Heartbeat episodes are around 42–51 minutes long (one hour with adverts). The opening episode of Series 11 was planned to be the show's first two-hour episode, but it was eventually split into a two-part story, \"Sweet Sixteen\" and \"She's Leaving Home\". In 1994 a one-off feature-length episode was filmed, starring Lloyd Owen as constable Tom Merriweather.\nHeartbeat repeats have appeared on ITV during the summer months (often billed on-screen as \"Classic Heartbeat\"), typically at 5.00 pm or, in 2006, at 4.00 pm. In 2006, episodes from the first few series were repeated again. Most of the swearing (\"bloody\", \"bastard\", etc.) and violence that was present in the early episodes was edited out for these daytime broadcasts.\nFor several years (as of 2016) Heartbeat reruns from series 11–18 have shown on ITV3, formerly in the original two-commercial-break format and latterly with three breaks. These repeats run daily each weekday lunchtime, with a second airing in an early-evening timeslot. Episodes from different series were shown on ITV3 at weekends.\nAs of autumn 2015, series 1–10 of Heartbeat was being aired on the then-new ITV Encore channel, which was only available on the Sky TV platform (until ITV Encore ceased broadcasting). These episodes were broadcast at a time when ITV had two commercial breaks and therefore have a running time of around 50 minutes. However ITV Encore has 60-minute programme slots which include three commercial breaks, so some scenes are edited or have been completely removed, purely for timing reasons. An example of this was the series 7 episode 22 \"Unconsidered Trifles\", in which the scene with PC Mike Bradley and Bernie Scripps herding cows back into the farm shed was completely omitted.\nAfter ITV Encore's closure in 2018, all series of Heartbeat aired each weekday on ITV3.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Ratings ===\n\nRatings slowly declined after series 13. The schedule was split in half to incorporate the launch of The Royal from Series 12. Series 1 and 2 (1992–1993) aired between April and June, Series 3–6 (1993–1996) moved to the autumn schedule between September and December when there were either 10 or 16 episodes per series. Series 7–11 (1997–2002), comprising 24 episodes, aired between September and March.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\n1995 – ITV Programme of the Year (TRIC Award) – Won\n1998 – ITV Programme of the Year – Won\n1998 – ITV Programme of the Year – National Television Award – Most Popular Newcomer (Jason Durr) – Nominated\n1999 – Best Performing Peak-Time Drama (ratings higher than Coronation Street and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?) – Won\n2007 – Best European Drama (voted by Norwegian viewers) – Won\n2008 – Best Drama (nominated by ITV Studios along with The Royal and Emmerdale) – Won\n\n\n== The Royal ==\n\nThe ITV medical drama series The Royal was originally a spin-off from Heartbeat, with the twelfth-series Heartbeat episode \"Out of the Blue\" serving as an introductory pilot for the show, with the Aidensfield police officers conducting parts of their investigations in \"The Royal\" hospital. The series initially had close ties with Heartbeat, and several Heartbeat characters made an appearance. Over time, however, the crossovers were dropped and The Royal developed its own identity.\n\n\n== Cancellation ==\nOn 5 June 2001, ITV planned cutbacks for dramas such as London's Burning, Heartbeat and Peak Practice to make room for new commissions which could have seen the programme's demise. A spokesman said \"The temptation is to just cancel long running shows. But if you do that you can spend years trying to find replacements that achieve the same viewing figures.\"\nKathleen Beedles, the new producer as of series 18, originally said Heartbeat was expected to continue until at least series 20 (at the time scheduled for 2010–11). However, it was announced on 28 January 2009 that production of both Heartbeat and its spin off show The Royal would be suspended for an unspecified period of time so that a large backlog of unbroadcast episodes could be cleared. Some newspaper reports interpreted this as meaning the show would be permanently cancelled. A report in The Telegraph suggested Heartbeat may return in \"a new lower budget form\".\nIn March 2009, a meeting to discuss the future of the show took place between ITV bosses and Heartbeat cast and crew members. The mood after the meeting was reportedly pessimistic about the show's long-term survival. Actor Steven Blakeley, who played PC Younger, said the cast were to be released after series 18, indicating the show had been cancelled and filming had finished.\nNews of the show's alleged cancellation prompted protests from Heartbeat fans around the world, as well as from communities in the Yorkshire Television region where the series was filmed, and where the Heartbeat-themed tourist trade was seen as an important part of the local economy.\nIn January 2010, rumours were published that Sky might buy Heartbeat from ITV and take over its production. In February 2010, it was reported that Adam Crozier, the newly appointed ITV chief executive, would be responsible for making the decision about the future of the show. In March 2010, a survey was carried out by the Whitby Gazette, a newspaper local to the area in which the show is set, asking \"Do you think that popular ITV show Heartbeat should be axed after 16 years?\" 71% of respondents voted \"No\", 19% voted \"Yes\" and 10% voted \"Don't Care\".\nSeries 18 was unusually protracted. Filming ran from May 2008 to May 2009. It premiered on 12 October 2008 and took a break after the sixth episode, then continued from 19 April 2009 to 14 June 2009. The last nine episodes were shown between 18 July 2010 and 12 September 2010 in the UK, but in Sweden on TV4 from 25 August 2009 to 4 September 2009, and in Denmark on TV 2 Charlie from 16 December 2009 to 24 December 2009. As of 3 January 2025, Heartbeat continues to be aired on TVO in Ontario, Canada.\nDuring the period of uncertainty about the show's future, ITV continued to maintain that reports of the show being \"axed\" were untrue, saying that production was \"taking a rest\" so that stockpiled episodes could be aired. However, on 25 June 2010, ITV finally confirmed that the show would be cancelled after series 18, with a spokesman saying \"Heartbeat has been an important part of the television landscape over the last 18 years and we are incredibly proud of what it achieved in its heyday as one of ITV1's top rated dramas\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Heartbeat episodes\nList of Heartbeat cast members\n\n\n== External links ==\nHeartbeat at IMDb\nHeartbeat at epguides.com\nBackgrounder on Heartbeat origins in the Nicholas Rhea \"Constable\" series", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:11:16Z"}

He played the role of James \"Sonny\" Crockett in the 1980s television series Miami Vice, for which he won a Golden Globe, and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. He also played the titular character in the 1990s series Nash Bridges. Johnson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1996.\nJohnson has appeared in films such as A Boy and His Dog (1975), The Hot Spot (1990), Guilty as Sin (1993), Tin Cup (1996), Machete (2010), Django Unchained (2012), Cold in July (2014) and Knives Out (2019). He released the albums Heartbeat (1986) and Let It Roll (1989) as a singer. His cover version of \"Heartbeat\" peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJohnson was born on December 15, 1949, in his grandmother's house in Flat Creek, Missouri. His mother, Nell (née Wilson), was a beautician. His father, Fredie Wayne Johnson, was a farmer. At the time of his birth, Johnson's mother and father were 16 and 19 years old, respectively. Johnson was raised in Wichita, Kansas, where his parents relocated when he was five years old and where his father worked for Boeing Aircraft. He has described his childhood as \"incredibly dysfunctional and abusive\" as his parents were both frequently absent and stressed. His father subjected the children to corporal punishment. According to Johnson, he was 12 years old when he lost his virginity to his 16-year-old babysitter. Johnson's parents divorced when he was 12. He continued to live with his mother, younger sister and two younger brothers until he was 13, at which time he ended up in juvenile court and was sent to live with his father in Missouri.\nHe moved back home to Wichita for his senior year of high school, working part-time as a butcher's apprentice and ladies' shoe salesman. He attended Wichita South High School, from which he graduated in 1967. When he was kicked off the school's football team, Johnson enrolled in a drama class to earn enough credits to graduate. Encouraged by his teacher, he played the lead role of Tony in West Side Story. He was also exposed to the plays  of Molière, Tennessee Williams and Shakespeare. During his last semester, he auditioned for the summer repertory program at the University of Kansas and won a partial scholarship. He was subsequently awarded a full scholarship to attend as a drama major. There, Johnson, 18, dated his 29-year-old acting teacher. In his sophomore year, he left to San Francisco after passing an audition for the American Conservatory Theater.\n\n\n== Acting career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nJohnson's first major role was in the 1969 stage production of Fortune and Men's Eyes, in which he played the lead role of Smitty. The play was produced and directed by Sal Mineo at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles. It included a \"shockingly realistic prison rape\" scene portrayed by Johnson. This exposure led to the quickly forgotten film The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart (1970). Johnson continued to work on stage, film and television without breaking into stardom. His notable films from this period were Zachariah (1971), Lollipop and Roses (1971), The Harrad Experiment (1973) (a film in which Johnson displayed frontal nudity) and A Boy and His Dog (1975). In 1976, Johnson was the roommate of Sal Mineo at the time Mineo was murdered.\n\n\n=== Miami Vice and stardom ===\n\nIn 1984, after years of struggling to establish himself as a TV actor, Johnson landed a starring role as undercover police detective Sonny Crockett in the Michael Mann/Universal Television cop series, Miami Vice. The show ran from 1984 to 1990. Miami Vice made Johnson \"a major international star\". According to Rolling Stone, \"No one had more swagger in the Reagan era than Don Johnson. As Miami Vice's Sonny Crockett, the undercover detective and professional stubble-cultivator who lived on a houseboat with his pet alligator Elvis, he embodied masculine cool in the era of coke binges and Lamborghinis\". The Sonny Crockett character typically wore thousand-dollar Versace and Armani suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari, wore expensive timepieces by Rolex and Ebel, and lived on an Endeavour yacht. Miami Vice was noted for its revolutionary use of music and cinematography, and for its glitzy take on the police drama genre. In the show, Crockett's partner was Ricardo Tubbs, played by Philip Michael Thomas.\nJohnson's work on Miami Vice earned him a Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Drama, in 1986. He was nominated for the same award in 1987. He was also nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.\nBetween seasons on Miami Vice, Johnson gained further renown through the TV miniseries The Long Hot Summer (1985), a remake of the 1958 film. During the time he was on Miami Vice, he had set up an hour-long music video/pay cable program with videocassette versions of the programs Johnson had hosted being handled by distributor CBS/Fox Video. The project was a tie-in to his first album Heartbeat, which was released by CBS/Epic Records in 1986.\nIn 1988, he starred in the romantic comedy Sweet Hearts Dance, alongside Susan Sarandon, Jeff Daniels and Elizabeth Perkins. In 1989 he played the sheriff of Los Angeles County Jerry Beck in John Frankenheimer's film Dead Bang.\nIn the early 1990s, Johnson played a variety of roles in well-produced films, including the role of drifter and car salesman Harry Maddox in Dennis Hopper's The Hot Spot (1990) opposite Jennifer Connelly and Virginia Madsen. He worked on two films with his wife Melanie Griffith, Paradise (1991) and Born Yesterday (1993). He appeared alongside Mickey Rourke in Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991), and in Sidney Lumet's thriller Guilty as Sin (1993), opposite Rebecca De Mornay.\n\n\n=== Nash Bridges ===\nJohnson later starred in the 1996–2001 CBS-TV police drama Nash Bridges with Cheech Marin, Jeff Perry, Jaime P. Gomez, Kelly Hu, Wendy Moniz, Annette O'Toole, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe as his daughter Cassidy, and James Gammon as his father Nick. Johnson portrayed the title role, an inspector (later promoted to captain) for the San Francisco Police Department. In Nash Bridges, Johnson was again paired with a flashy convertible car, a yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda.\n\n\n=== 2001–2010 ===\n\nIn the fall of 2005, Johnson briefly starred in The WB courtroom television drama show Just Legal as a jaded lawyer with a young and idealistic protégé/partner (Jay Baruchel); the show was canceled in October 2005 after just three of the eight produced episodes aired. In January 2007, Johnson began a run in the West End of London production of Guys and Dolls as Nathan Detroit.\nJohnson also had a role in the Norwegian comedy Lange Flate Ballær 2 (\"Long Flat Balls II\"), directed by Johnson's friend Harald Zwart. Johnson did the movie as a favor to Zwart. The movie was launched on March 14, 2008, in Norway, with Johnson making an appearance at the premiere. He next appeared in When in Rome with Danny DeVito, Anjelica Huston and Kristen Bell.\nJohnson had a supporting role in Robert Rodriguez's film Machete. Johnson played Von Jackson, \"a twisted border vigilante leading a small army\". The film was released on September 3, 2010. In October 2010, he began appearing on the HBO series Eastbound & Down, playing Kenny Powers' long-lost father, going by the alias \"Eduardo Sanchez\". He also reprised his role as Sonny Crockett for a Nike commercial with LeBron James in which the NBA player contemplates acting and appears alongside Johnson on Miami Vice.\n\n\n=== 2011–present ===\nIn September 2011, Johnson had a cameo in the comedy A Good Old Fashioned Orgy with Jason Sudeikis. Johnson had a supporting role in the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained, playing a southern plantation owner named Spencer 'Big Daddy' Bennett.

He also appeared in a Nash Bridges television film with co-star Cheech Marin on the USA Network in 2021.\nIn April 2024, it was announced that Johnson would be starring in the Ryan Murphy drama television series, Doctor Odyssey, which premiered on ABC and Hulu on September 26, 2024. On June 27, 2025, the series was canceled by default after one season after the main cast's options expired.\n\n\n== Music career ==\nJohnson released two albums of pop music in the 1980s. Heartbeat was released in 1986. Let it Roll was released in 1989. His single \"Heartbeat\" reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.\n\"Till I Loved You\", a duet with then-girlfriend Barbra Streisand, was a top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. It was released on the Columbia Records studio album Till I Loved You on October 25, 1988. The song was re-released on the Streisand album Duets in 2002.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Reputation ===\nOutside his acting career, Johnson developed a reputation for leading a luxurious and hedonistic lifestyle. He was known for his hard-partying and having a large number of romantic relationships. At the height of his Miami Vice fame in the 1980s, he was a frequent drug user, including alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine, as well as Quaaludes. Johnson has described hosting parties where he and friends would invite numerous models through local modeling agencies. He was also a regular at \"super-exclusive\" parties in Florida attended by politicians, police, drug dealers, and \"the best-looking hookers in the business\".\n\n\n=== Relationships and family ===\n\nIn 1968, at the age of 18, Johnson married a dancer; the marriage was annulled around two months later. Her name has not been made public.\nCirca 1971, Johnson lived with self-described \"groupie\" Pamela Des Barres.\nIn 1973, Johnson married his second wife, but the marriage was annulled days later. Her name has also not been made public, though he has called her a \"rich bimbo\".\nDuring the first half of 1972, Johnson met Melanie Griffith, the 14-year-old daughter of his Harrad Experiment co-star Tippi Hedren. The pair moved in together when Griffith was 15 and Johnson was 23. On her 18th birthday they became engaged, and were married in January 1976; they separated that July and divorced in November.\nJohnson dated country music singer Tanya Tucker after the two worked together on the 1979 TV movies Amateur Night at the Dixie Bar and Grill and The Rebels.\nIn 1980, Johnson dated Sally Adams, mother of actress Nicollette Sheridan.\nIn January 1981, he split from Tucker after meeting Warhol model Patti D'Arbanville at a Los Angeles restaurant. The pair lived together from 1981 to 1985 but never married. Johnson and D'Arbanville have a son, Jesse Wayne Johnson (born December 7, 1982).\nIn the early 1980s, Johnson dated model Donya Fiorentino after he moved in next door to her family in Florida. Fiorentino broke up with Johnson but reunited with him in 1986 after she broke up with Andrew Ridgeley.\nIn her 2000 autobiography Cybill Disobedience, Cybill Shepherd wrote of a liaison with Johnson during the making of the television miniseries The Long Hot Summer (1985).\nJohnson next had a relationship with Barbra Streisand, lasting into at least September 1988.\nHe was briefly involved with his Dead Bang (1989) co-star Penelope Ann Miller.\nJust days after breaking up with Streisand, Johnson, then 38, was linked to 18-year-old Uma Thurman.\nJohnson then reunited with Griffith, who conceived his child close to the start of 1989, Dakota Johnson (born October 4, 1989); they were married again from June of that year until 1996.\nIn 1995, Johnson was romantically linked to model Kari Whitman.\nIn 1996–1997, Johnson dated Jodi Lyn O'Keefe, who played his daughter on Nash Bridges.\nOn April 29, 1999, Johnson married San Francisco socialite and Montessori nursery school teacher Kelley Phleger, former longtime girlfriend of Governor Gavin Newsom, at the Pacific Heights mansion of Ann and Gordon Getty. Actor Robert Wagner served as best man, and Mayor Willie Brown presided over the civil ceremony. Johnson and Phleger have three children together: a daughter, Atherton Grace (born December 28, 1999), and two sons, Jasper Breckinridge (born June 6, 2002), and Deacon (born April 29, 2006).\nJohnson was \"best friends\" with journalist Hunter S. Thompson, who wrote for Nash Bridges, and his daughter Dakota saw Thompson as a \"godfather figure.\" Johnson is also a friend of socialite Denise Hale, the former wife of director Vincente Minnelli. The two were once the subject of reports alleging a romantic relationship, which both denied, stating they were merely friends.\n\n\n=== Powerboat racing ===\nJohnson entered powerboat racing and sometimes raced with Kurt Russell and Chuck Norris. In 1986, Johnson achieved his first motor sport victory. He won a 1,100-mile (1,800 km) powerboat race up the Mississippi River from New Orleans to St. Louis. Characterized by shipmates as an aggressive, fearless pilot who did not make mistakes, Johnson became American Power Boat Association's World Champion of the Offshore World Cup in 1988.\n\n\n=== Legal matters ===\nIn April 1997, Johnson was sued by his former chauffeur and a former production assistant for Nash Bridges, both of whom accused him of sexual harassment. Johnson accused them of defamation and alleged they had conspired to extort $1.5 million from him. In January 1998, Johnson and the two women dropped civil charges against each other in a confidential settlement.\nIn July 2001, a woman sued Johnson, alleging that he grabbed her inappropriately at a sushi bar in San Francisco. The district attorney reviewed the evidence and declined to file criminal charges. Johnson's representatives maintained the accusations were meritless.\nIn November 2002, German customs officers at the Swiss–German border performed a routine search of Johnson's car. Bank statements evidencing US$8 billion in transactions were found in the trunk of his car. He was accompanied in his black Mercedes-Benz by three men: an investment adviser, a personal assistant, and a third unknown individual who could not be identified. Initially it was thought Johnson was involved in money laundering, but he was cleared of wrongdoing.\nIn May 2008, within hours of losing his Woody Creek, Colorado, home to foreclosure, Johnson paid off his $14.5 million debt.\nIn July 2010, a Los Angeles jury awarded Johnson $23.2 million in a lawsuit against production company Rysher Entertainment, from whom Johnson sought a share of profits commensurate with his ownership of half the copyright of Nash Bridges. Rysher announced it would appeal the verdict. In January 2013, Rysher settled the suit with a $19 million payment.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Featured singles ===\n\n\n== Videography ==\n1987: Heartbeat -  Full Length Video (VHS) - (Release date: May 10, 1987)\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHershkovits, David.

The items for the record, which is carried on both the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft, were selected for NASA by a committee chaired by Carl Sagan of Cornell University. Included are natural sounds (including some made by animals), musical selections from different cultures and eras, spoken greetings in 55 languages, human sounds like footsteps and laughter, and printed messages from President Jimmy Carter and U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim.\n\n\n== Greetings ==\nThe first audio section contains a spoken greeting in English from Secretary-General of the United Nations Kurt Waldheim.\nThe second audio section (\"Greetings in 55 Languages\") contains spoken greetings in 55 languages. The original plan was to use greetings made by United Nations delegates, but various problems with these recordings led to new recordings being made at Cornell University by people from the foreign-language departments. The number of native speakers of these 55 languages combined (excluding L2 speakers) is over 4.7 billion people, comprising over 65% of the world population. It includes four Chinese languages (marked with **), 12 South Asian languages (marked #) and five ancient languages (marked §), listed here in alphabetical order:\n\nThis is a list of the recorded greetings in order of appearance on their respective tracks.\n\n\n== Sounds ==\nThe next audio section is devoted to the \"sounds of Earth\" that include:\n\nIncluded within the Sounds of Earth audio portion of the Golden Record is a track containing the inspirational message per aspera ad astra in Morse code. Translated from Latin, it means 'through hardships to the stars.'\n\n\n=== Brainwaves ===\nThe life signs included on the record were an hour-long recording of the heartbeat and brainwaves of Ann Druyan, who would later marry Carl Sagan. The hour-long recording was compressed into the span of a minute to be able to fit into the record. In the epilogue of the 1997 book Billions and Billions, she describes the experience:\n\nEarlier I had asked Carl if those putative extraterrestrials of a billion years from now could conceivably interpret the brain waves of a meditator. Who knows? A billion years is a long, long time, was his reply. On the chance that it might be possible why don't we give it a try?\nTwo days after our life-changing phone call, I entered a laboratory at Bellevue Hospital in New York City and was hooked up to a computer that turned all the data from my brain and heart into sound. I had a one-hour mental itinerary of the information I wished to convey. I began by thinking about the history of Earth and the life it sustains. To the best of my abilities I tried to think something of the history of ideas and human social organization. I thought about the predicament that our civilization finds itself in and about the violence and poverty that make this planet a hell for so many of its inhabitants. Toward the end I permitted myself a personal statement of what it was like to fall in love.\nOn February 12, 2010, an interview with Ann Druyan was aired on NPR during which the above was explained in more detail.\n\n\n== Music ==\nFollowing the section on the sounds of Earth, there is an eclectic 90-minute selection of music from many cultures, including Eastern and Western classics. The selections include:\n\nIt has been claimed that Sagan had originally asked for permission to include \"Here Comes the Sun\" from the Beatles' album Abbey Road; but while the Beatles favored it, EMI opposed it and the song was not included. However, this has been refuted by Timothy Ferris, who worked on the selection with Sagan; he said the song was never even considered for inclusion.\n\n\n== Images ==\nAlong with the audio, the record contains a collection of 116 pictures (one of which is for calibration) detailing but not limited to human life on Earth and the planet itself. Many pictures are annotated with one or many indications of scales of time, size or mass. Some images also contain indications of chemical composition. All measures used on the pictures are first defined in the first few images using physical references.\nFollowing is a list of all the images contained in the Voyager Golden Record together with a description of the nature of the image and what annotations were included in them, and when copyright permits, the actual image.\nAfter NASA had received criticism over the nudity on the Pioneer plaque (line drawings of a naked man and woman), the agency chose not to allow Sagan and his colleagues to include George Hester's photograph of a nude man and woman on the record. Instead, only a silhouette of the couple was included.\n\nAn official statement by President Jimmy Carter was included as images (positions 117, 118). It reads, in part:This Voyager spacecraft was constructed by the United States of America. We are a community of 240 million human beings among the more than 4 billion who inhabit the planet Earth. We human beings are still divided into nation states, but these states are rapidly becoming a global civilization.\nWe cast this message into the cosmos ... It is likely to survive a billion years into our future, when our civilization is profoundly altered and the surface of the Earth may be vastly changed. Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, some – perhaps many – may have inhabited planets and space faring civilizations. If one such civilization intercepts Voyager and can understand these recorded contents, here is our message: This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts, and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope some day, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunication with extraterrestrial intelligence\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Golden Record, the official NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory page about the record\nThe Infinite Voyager : The Golden Record at the Wayback Machine (archived November 6, 2014), an MIT page of then-student Lily Bui comprising a collection of recordings included\nVoyager 1 audio on Internet Archive\nGolden Record: Sounds of Earth, an official NASA SoundCloud page with recordings\nvoyager.damninteresting.com, an interactive multimedia presentation of the contents\nThe 116 images NASA wants aliens to see,  Vox", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:11:18Z"}
{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "27673328", "title": "Heartbeat (Enrique Iglesias song)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_(Enrique_Iglesias_song)", "content_length": 7983, "text": "\"Heartbeat\" is a song by Spanish singer and songwriter Enrique Iglesias. The song was written by Iglesias, along with his long-term collaborators, Jamie Scott and Mark Taylor, for his ninth studio album Euphoria (2010). The mid-tempo ballad, produced by Taylor, features guest vocals from American singer Nicole Scherzinger. The song has a melody based on futuristic piano sounds and incorporates elements of dance music. The Rudi Wells' Open Heart Remix of the song later appeared on Scherzinger's debut studio album Killer Love (2011).\nThe song was released as the album's third overall single, though it is the second English-language single, on 8 June 2010 in the United States and later in October 2010 France and the United Kingdom. Critics praised the song for the way that Iglesias and Scherzinger's voices complemented each other. An accompanying music video features the pair in emotive mood-lit scenes, where digitally produced colored heartbeats react as they interact with each and the lyrics of the song. Another version of the song titled as \"Heartbeat (India Mix)\" featuring Indian singer Sunidhi Chauhan was included on a special Indian edition of Euphoria.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\n\"Heartbeat\" is a mid-tempo electropop dance ballad featuring a melody led by futuristic piano notes. It was written by Iglesias, Jamie Scott and Mark Taylor, who also produced the song. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic pointed out that the song had an \"icy texture\" while Becky Bain of Idolator noted that the duo's vocals carry much emotion. \"Heartbeat\" was also featured on Nicole Scherzinger's debut album, Killer Love (2011). The version featured on the album is the \"Rudi Well's Open Heart Remix\". Ellwood noted that the remix \"added beats changing the tone of the song completely.\" and changed the song from dance, to more electronic rock and electro-industrial tendencies.\nThe song is written in the key of B ♭ major.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nRobbie Daw of Idolator called the song a \"fragile and beautiful\" track, whilst his colleague, Becky Bain, said that the song is a \"perfect match for the duo's voices\". Bain also said \"['Heartbeat'] is thankfully kept under-produced, letting the emotions of both singers (who keep their vocals to a breathy, yearning coo) shine through.\" In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the song is not an old-fashioned ballad, instead it \"draws on the chilly textures of [singer-songwriter/producer] Ryan Tedder.\" Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars and described \"the beats that mimic the pulse of a pounding chest, the simple-but-effective piano hook, the lyrics about \"stealing your heart away\" as cheesy.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nIglesias and Scherzinger appeared together to perform the song live on UK day-time TV programme, This Morning on 8 October 2010. He performed it live on Dancing with the Stars in Denmark on 22 October 2010. The following week it debuted at number five on the Danish Singles Chart. He also performed in live on The X Factor in Australia on 1 November, with DJ Havana Brown replacing Scherzinger. The duo reprised their performance at the Capital FM's Summertime Ball. They performed \"Heartbeat\" during Iglesias' set.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video treatment for \"Heartbeat\" was directed by Hiro Murai and premiered on 14 September 2010. It features the use of an inner throbbing lights and Scherzinger wearing a lace outfit. The overall concept of the video sees a \"shirtless Iglesias against a dark black background, while red and orange 'heartbeats' are added in simulation with his heartbeat. Then Nicole Scherzinger, who is sitting nude, waist-up against a solid black background, but with blue and purple 'heartbeats'.\" The music video was filmed in Kentwood, Michigan.\nA music video for \"Heartbeat (India Mix)\" was made and Nicole Scherzinger was replaced by legendary Indian singer Sunidhi Chauhan alongside Enrique for that version.\n\n\n=== Synopsis ===\n\nThe video starts off with Enrique seen shirtless against a dark black background. As the music starts, Enrique is seen singing while digitally added red and orange \"heartbeats\" are added in simulation with his heartbeat. Nicole breaks into the song where she is seen sitting nude waist up against a solid black background. Similar to Enrique, digitally added blue and purple \"heartbeats\" are added in simulation with her heartbeat. In the following scene, Nicole and Enrique are seen together in a white, mirrored room. Enrique is wearing a red T-shirt and jeans while Nicole is wearing a red bra and underwear with a black lace dress over-top. The video cuts to a scene where the hook of the song kicks in; they're seen face to face looking like they're about to kiss while singing their parts. During the scene they're seen with a black spotlight on them while alternating blue and green background lighting is added. The video ends with Enrique's \"heartbeat\" darkening with each beat until it eventually fades out into a solid black screen.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nA reviewer from 'Current Movie Reviews' said \"Nicole Scherzinger and Enrique Iglesias did not fail to deliver a steaming hot video for their song 'Heartbeat'. Every moment of this video is sensuous. The electric lights beating as their hearts in their silhouetted bodies is pure genius. The hall of mirrors and the way they are searching for each other in them is imagery that carries the viewer right into the video. The sparks sizzling off these two is believable and I was pretty sure I was feeling their hearts beat together, even as mine started pounding.\" Christine Borges of The Miami New Times agreed with that the video was steamy. She said \"[Enrique and Nicole] are put in some compromising positions while missing the majority of their clothes. But how much can you really see? Thanks to some dark lighting, all the important bits aren't really visible. But there's the knowledge that they're barely dressed, and sometimes, that's enough. Pulsing \"heartbeat\" lighting gives the impression of a laser show on their bare bodies, and Iglesias has his legs sprawled out and his head tilted back.

In Robert Dimery's book 1000 Songs: You Must Hear Before You Die,  it was said: \"The Stockholm siblings' love of synth pop, minimal beats and electronica create together a moving masterpiece. Singer Karin Dreijer's hypnotic vocals recall both Björk and Siouxsie Sioux with [Dreijer's] icy delivery of magical lines\". \nThe song has been covered by many acts such as José González, Royal Teeth, Scala & Kolacny Brothers, Amason and Ellie Goulding.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe song has received critical acclaim since its release. MusicOMH said that the song's \"emotive lyrics merge with forward thinking production to create one of the most exciting electronica releases of the year\", and Contactmusic.com stated the song had \"clever synth beats and Björkesque vocals\" with the ability to \"instil some fun and nostalgia into music.\" Gigwise.com said that the song was \"perhaps one of the most hypnotic and haunting electronic songs of recent times, [...] innately infectious from the outset.\" Several reviews commented that the song had a 1980s feel.\n\n\n== Track listings ==\nUK CD\n\"Heartbeats\" (original) – 3:53\n\"Heartbeats\" (Rex the Dog remix) – 6:12\n\"Heartbeats\" (The Knife techno remix) – 2:47\n\"Afraid of You\" – 3:48\nUK 12-inch vinyl\n\"Heartbeats\" (original) – 3:53\n\"Heartbeats\" (Style of Eye remix) –\n\"Heartbeats\" (Rex the Dog remix) – 6:12\n\"Heartbeats\" (The Knife techno remix) – 2:47\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nChristoffer Berg – mixing\nRex the Dog – re-mixing, producer\nLinus Eklow – re-mixing\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== José González version ==\n\nArgentine-Swedish singer-songwriter José González covered \"Heartbeats\" for his debut studio album, Veneer (2003), and released as its lead single in January 2006.

{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "272802", "title": "John Ritter", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ritter", "content_length": 13503, "text": "Johnathan Southworth Ritter (September 17, 1948 – September 11, 2003) was an American actor. He was a son of the singing cowboy star Tex Ritter and the father of actors Jason and Tyler Ritter. He played Jack Tripper on the popular ABC sitcom Three's Company (1977–1984), and received a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for the role in 1984. Ritter briefly reprised the role on the spin-off Three's a Crowd, which aired for one season, producing 22 episodes before its cancellation in 1985.\nHe appeared in over 100 films and television series combined and performed on Broadway, with roles including adult Ben Hanscom in It (1990), Problem Child (1990), Problem Child 2 (1991), a dramatic turn in Sling Blade (1996), and Bad Santa in 2003 (his final live action film, which was dedicated to his memory). In 2002, Don Knotts called Ritter the \"greatest physical comedian on the planet\". His final roles include voicing the title character on the PBS children's program Clifford the Big Red Dog (2000–2003), for which he received four Daytime Emmy Award nominations, and as Paul Hennessy on the ABC sitcom 8 Simple Rules (2002–2003). His style of comedy is based on musical and character comedy.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJohnathan Southworth Ritter was born on September 17, 1948, at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California. His father, Tex Ritter (1905–1974), was a singing cowboy and film star, and his mother, Dorothy Fay (née Southworth; 1915–2003), was an actress. He had an older brother, Thomas \"Tom\" Ritter. Ritter attended Hollywood High School, where he was student body president. While a teenager, Ritter's right eye was permanently injured by a projectile flying into the car in which he was riding. This resulted in his right pupil having a strange appearance and only having peripheral vision in that eye for the rest of his life.\nRitter attended the University of Southern California and majored in psychology with plans to have a career in politics. He later changed his major to theater arts and attended the USC School of Dramatic Arts (formerly School of Theatre).  Ritter was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity at USC.  While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970. Along with having theater arts at USC, he also had studied acting at the Stella Adler Academy.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first television acting experience was as a campus revolutionary in the television series Dan August starring Burt Reynolds and future Three's Company co-star Norman Fell. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film The Barefoot Executive. He made guest appearances on the television series Hawaii Five-O, M*A*S*H, and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series The Waltons from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom Three's Company (the Americanized version of the 1970s British Thames Television series Man About the House) in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played Ringo Starr's manager on the television special Ringo. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in the animated film The Flight of Dragons.\n\nRitter became a household name on Three's Company, portraying struggling culinary student Jack Tripper with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite Joyce DeWitt and Suzanne Somers, and then later Jenilee Harrison and Priscilla Barnes. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the co-ed living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the ratings in the United States before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off, Three's a Crowd, ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of Three's Company, Ritter appeared in the films Hero at Large, Americathon, and They All Laughed. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for Graham Nash's song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the album of the same name. \nHooperman was Ritter's first regular television role after Three's Company. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith (Debrah Farentino) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for his work on Hooperman. Ritter won a People's Choice Award for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator, in Hearts Afire. This series starred Markie Post as Georgie Anne Lahti and Billy Bob Thornton as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production Noises Off in 1992.\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of films, most notably Problem Child and its first sequel. He co-starred with Jim Belushi in 1987's Real Men and played the lead role in Blake Edwards' 1989 film Skin Deep. He appeared in the film version of Noises Off, rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the Oscar-winning Sling Blade (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with Olivier Gruner in the 1996 action film Mercenary. \nRitter starred in many television films, including Gramps (1995), co-starring with Andy Griffith, Rob Hedden's The Colony (1995) with Hal Linden, Stephen King's It, Danielle Steel's Heartbeat with Polly Draper, and It Came from the Sky in 1999 with Yasmine Bleeth. Ritter also made guest appearances on television shows, such as Felicity, Ally McBeal, Scrubs, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. He also provided the voice of the title character in the animated children's show Clifford the Big Red Dog and its animated film adaptation Clifford's Really Big Movie (2004), a role for which he received four Emmy nominations. His final film was Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory. At the time of his death, he was starring in 8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nIn 2000, Ritter co-starred with Henry Winkler in Neil Simon's The Dinner Party at the Music Box Theatre on Broadway, portraying Claude Pichon. It ran for 364 performances. Ritter won the Theatre World Award in 2001 for his performance in that work.\nHe starred in \"J For J\" at LA's Court Theatre from March 14 – April 21, 2002, alongside Jeff Kober and Jenny Sullivan. It was directed by Joseph Fuqua and written by Jenny Sullivan. In 2003, Ritter made his final stage appearance in All About Eve at the Ahmanson Theatre.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn October 16, 1977, Ritter married actress Nancy Morgan, with whom he had three children. They divorced on September 1, 1996. He married actress Amy Yasbeck on September 18, 1999, at the Murphy Theatre in Wilmington, Ohio. They had a child born five years to the day before Ritter's death. Yasbeck played his love interest in the first two Problem Child films, though as two different characters. Yasbeck also played Ritter's wife in two sitcom appearances. In 1991, both were guest stars on The Cosby Show, in which Yasbeck played the in-labor wife of Ritter's basketball coach character. In 1996, Ritter guest-starred on Yasbeck's sitcom, Wings, as the estranged husband of Yasbeck's character, Casey.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nOn September 11, 2003, Ritter was rehearsing for 8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter on the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, California, when he suddenly fell ill: sweating profusely, vomiting, and complaining of chest pain. He was taken across the street to the Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center (the same hospital where he had been born) at 6:00 pm. Ritter was initially treated by emergency room physicians for an assumed heart attack; however, his condition quickly worsened. Ritter was then diagnosed with an aortic dissection and taken into surgery, but was pronounced dead at 10:48 pm, at the age of 54.\nA private funeral for Ritter was held in Los Angeles on September 15, 2003, after which he was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.\nIn 2008, Ritter's widow Amy Yasbeck, on behalf of herself and Ritter's children, filed lawsuits against doctors involved in Ritter's treatment and Providence St. Joseph Medical Center. Some of those lawsuits were settled out of court, for a total of $14 million, including a settlement for $9.4 million with Providence St. Joseph. A $67 million wrongful-death lawsuit was brought against two of the physicians who treated Ritter on the day of his death, for misdiagnosing his condition as a heart attack and for failing to detect an enlargement of Ritter's aorta when he had a full-body scan two years earlier. The jury concluded that the doctors were not negligent and thus not responsible for his death.\n\n\n=== Response and legacy ===\nMany of Ritter's colleagues expressed sorrow following the news of his death. Zach Braff, who worked with Ritter on Scrubs, called Ritter a \"comic hero\" of his and said he had approached series creator Bill Lawrence to get Ritter to play his character J.D.'s father (which Ritter did for two episodes and was slated to return for a third the week following his death). Katey Sagal testified in the wrongful death lawsuit, calling Ritter a \"funny man who was funny like nobody's business\". His Three's Company co-star Joyce DeWitt remarked he was \"Impossible to forget. Impossible not to love.\" \n8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter was later retitled 8 Simple Rules following Ritter's death and continued for one and a half more seasons before its cancellation in 2005. Ritter's character, Paul Hennessy, was said to have died after collapsing in a grocery store while buying milk. ABC aired the first three episodes of the show's second season that had been taped before his death, each of which was introduced by Katey Sagal. The remainder of the show dealt with the family trying to grapple with Paul's death. New male characters, played by James Garner and David Spade, were later added to the main cast as Ritter's replacements. Shortly before his death, Ritter had done a week-long taping with Hollywood Squares, which was aired as a tribute to him, introduced by Henry Winkler, the executive producer of the show and a very close friend of Ritter's. Four days after Ritter's death, Nick at Nite ran an all-night Three's Company marathon dedicated to his memory.\nIn 2004, Ritter was posthumously given an Emmy nomination for playing Paul Hennessy in 8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter but lost to Kelsey Grammer for his performances as the title character of Frasier. Upon accepting his trophy, Grammer's remarks included comments made in tribute and remembrance of Ritter. Ritter's final films, Bad Santa and Clifford's Really Big Movie, along with a Season 4 episode of Scrubs (his character in this series died, as well), the Season 8 King of the Hill episode \"Stressed for Success\" (in which he played music teacher Eugene Grandy) and Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up (in which he played Great Uncle Stew) were all dedicated to his memory.\nOn June 6, 2008, Hollywood High School dedicated a mural of Ritter painted by Eloy Torrez. \n\n\n==== The John Ritter Foundation for Aortic Health ====\nIn March 2010, the Thoracic Aortic Disease (TAD) Coalition, in partnership with Yasbeck and the John Ritter Foundation (JRF), announced the creation of the \"Ritter Rules\" which are life-saving reminders to recognize, treat and prevent thoracic aortic dissection. The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Video games ===\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\n1983: Star on the Walk of Fame – 6627 Hollywood Boulevard; he and Tex Ritter were the first father-and-son pair to be so honored in different categories.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nYasbeck, Amy (2010).

Noem was elected as the first female governor of South Dakota in 2018 with the endorsement of incumbent president Donald Trump. She gained national attention during the COVID-19 pandemic for opposing statewide mask mandates in favor of voluntary measures. Noem has conservative positions on most domestic issues, particularly gun rights, abortion, and immigration. Since her appointment as Secretary of Homeland Security, she has generated significant controversy for her policies on immigration.\nNoem is a farmer, rancher, and member of the Civil Air Patrol. She has published two autobiographies, Not My First Rodeo: Lessons from the Heartland (2022) and No Going Back (2024), the latter of which sparked controversy for its account of her killing a young family dog and false claims about meeting with foreign leaders.

She obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in political science from South Dakota State University in 2012 while serving as a U.S. representative. The Washington Post dubbed her Capitol Hill's \"most powerful intern\" for receiving college intern credits from her position as a member of Congress.\n\n\n== South Dakota House of Representatives (2007–2011) ==\nIn 2006, Noem won a seat as a Republican in the South Dakota House of Representatives, representing the 6th district, comprising parts of Beadle, Clark, Codington, Hamlin, and Kingsbury counties. In 2006, she won with 39% of the vote, and received $6330 in direct contributions to her campaign. In 2008, she was reelected with 41% of the vote.\nNoem served for four years, from 2007 to 2010. She was an assistant majority leader during her second term. During her tenure, Noem was the prime sponsor of 11 bills that became law, including several property tax reforms and two bills to increase gun rights in South Dakota. In 2009, she served as vice chair of the Agriculture Land Assessment Advisory Task Force. Senator Larry Rhoden chaired the task force, and later served as her lieutenant governor. During her tenure, she joined the Civil Air Patrol as a \"state legislative member\".\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives (2011–2019) ==\n\nIn 2010, Noem ran for South Dakota's at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. She won the Republican primary and defeated incumbent Democrat Stephanie Herseth Sandlin in the general election. Noem was reelected three times, serving in Congress until 2019.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\n\nThe 2011 House Republican 87-member freshman class elected Noem as liaison to the House Republican leadership, making her the second woman member of the House GOP leadership. According to The Hill, her role was to push the leadership to make significant cuts to federal government spending and to help Speaker John Boehner manage the expectations of the freshman class. In March 2011, Republican Representative Pete Sessions of Texas named Noem one of the 12 regional directors for the National Republican Congressional Committee during the 2012 election campaign.\nOn March 8, 2011, she announced the formation of a leadership political action committee, KRISTI PAC. Former South Dakota Lieutenant Governor Steve Kirby is its treasurer. Noem was among the top freshman Republicans in PAC fundraising in the first quarter of 2011, raising $169,000 from PACs.\n\n\n==== Abortion ====\nNoem co-sponsored legislation that would federally ban abortion. In 2015, she co-sponsored a bill to amend the 14th Amendment to define human life and personhood as beginning at fertilization, federally banning abortion from the moment of fertilization. She also voted for a bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n==== Energy and environment ====\nNoem denies the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2022 she said she believes \"the science has been varied on it, and it hasn't been proven to me that what we're doing is affecting the climate.\"\nNoem has said that the U.S. needs an \"all-of-the-above energy approach\" that includes renewables like wind and ethanol while still realizing the need for a \"balanced energy mix\" that ends American dependence on foreign oil.\nNoem supported the Keystone XL Pipeline and supports offshore oil drilling. She co-sponsored three bills that she argued would reduce American dependence on foreign oil by ending the 2010 United States deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and reopening sales on oil leases in the Gulf and off the coast of Virginia. In 2011, she sponsored a measure to block Environmental Protection Agency funding for tighter air pollution standards for coarse particulates.\nNoem opposed a bill introduced by South Dakota Senator Tim Johnson that would designate over 48,000 acres (190 km2) of the Buffalo Gap National Grassland as protected wilderness. She supports the designation of the land as a national grassland. She said the land is already managed as roadless areas similar to wilderness and argued that changing the land's designation to wilderness would further limit leaseholder access to the land and imperil grazing rights.\n\n\n==== Foreign affairs ====\nFrom 2013 to 2015, Noem served on the House Armed Services Committee, where she worked on the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act. Her appointment to the committee was seen as a benefit to South Dakota's Ellsworth Air Force Base. In March 2011, Noem was critical of President Barack Obama's approach to the NATO-led military intervention in the 2011 Libyan civil war, calling on him to provide more information about the U.S.'s role in the conflict, and characterizing his statements as vague and ambiguous.\n\n\n==== Health care ====\nNoem opposes the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has voted to repeal it. Having unsuccessfully sought to repeal it, she sought to defund it while retaining measures such as the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the provision allowing parents to keep their children on their health insurance plan into their 20s, and the high-risk pools. Noem wanted to add such provisions to federal law as limits on medical malpractice lawsuits and allowing patients to buy health insurance plans from other states. She supported cuts to Medicaid funding proposed by Republican Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan. A study found that this action would reduce benefits for South Dakota Medicaid recipients by 55 percent.\n\n\n==== Immigrants and refugees ====\nNoem supported President Donald Trump's 2017 Executive Order 13769, that suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and banned all travel to the U.S. by nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. She said she supported a temporary ban on accepting refugees from \"terrorist-held\" areas, but \"did not address whether she supports other aspects of the order, which led to the detention of legal U.S. residents such as green-card holders, and people with dual citizenship as they reentered the country\" in the aftermath of the order's issuance.\nIn 2019, Noem consented to South Dakota's participation in the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program following a Trump executive order that allowed state and local governments to opt out.\n\n\n==== In-vitro fertilization and embryonic stem-cell research ====\nIn August 2010, while running for Congress, Noem responded to a questionnaire from the Christian Coalition voter guide indicating that she would vote to ban embryonic stem-cell research. In 2015, she co-sponsored legislation to amend the 14th Amendment to define human life and personhood as beginning at the moment of fertilization, without exceptions for in-vitro fertilization or embryonic stem-cell research.\n\n\n==== Taxes ====\nIn 2017, Noem was on the conference committee that negotiated the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which she touted as giving the average South Dakota family a $1,200 tax cut.\nIn 2018, Noem was reported to have \"pitched the idea to members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus\" to attach her online sales tax bill to the government funding package as part of an omnibus. A court case under consideration in the South Dakota Supreme Court involved requiring \"certain out-of-state retailers to collect its sales taxes.\" Noem said that South Dakota businesses (and by extension businesses nationwide) \"could be forced to comply with 1,000 different tax structures nationwide without the tools necessary to do so\", adding that her legislation \"provides a necessary fix.\"\nNoem has called the budget deficit one of the most important issues facing Congress. She cosponsored H. J. Res. 2, which would require that total spending for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts. She cited the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Medicaid, high-speed rail projects, cap-and-trade technical assistance, and subsidies for the Washington Metro rapid transit system as examples of federal programs where she would like to see cuts.\nIn 2011, Noem indicated that she would vote to raise the federal debt ceiling, but only if \"tied to budget reforms that change the way we spend our dollars and how Washington, D.C., does business. It won't just be a one-time spending cut.\" She ultimately voted for S. 365, The Budget Control Act of 2011, which allowed Obama to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for spending cuts to be decided by a bipartisan committee. She also said she wanted to eliminate the estate tax, lower the corporate tax rate, and simplify the tax code. She said she would not raise taxes to balance the budget.\nCommittee assignments\n\nCommittee on Ways and Means\nSubcommittee on Human Resources\nSubcommittee on Select Revenue Measures\nCaucus memberships\n\nRepublican Study Committee\nCongressional Arts Caucus\nAfterschool Caucuses\nCongressional Western Caucus\n\n\n== Governor of South Dakota (2019–2025) ==\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== 2018 ====\n\nIn November 2016, Noem announced she would run for governor of South Dakota in 2018 rather than seek reelection to Congress. She defeated South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley in the June Republican primary, 56 to 44 percent, and Democratic nominee Billie Sutton in the general election, 51 to 48 percent.\n\n\n==== 2022 ====\n\nIn November 2021, Noem announced she was running for reelection as governor. State Representative Steven Haugaard, a Republican, announced he was running against Noem. In February 2022, House Democratic Minority Leader Jamie Smith announced he was seeking the Democratic nomination.\nIn the Republican primary in June, Noem defeated Haugaard, 76% to 24%. In the general election, she defeated Smith, 62% to 35%. Despite predictions of a competitive race, Noem flipped 17 counties that had previously voted Democratic and set a record for the most votes received by a candidate for governor in South Dakota.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\n\nNoem was sworn in as South Dakota governor on January 5, 2019. She is the first woman to hold that office.\n\n\n==== Abortion ====\nNoem is anti-abortion. She has been lauded by the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List and said she intends to maintain her 100% anti-abortion voting record.\nIn 2019, Noem signed bills restricting abortion, saying they would \"crack down on abortion providers in South Dakota\" and that a \"strong and growing body of medical research provides evidence that unborn babies can feel, think, and recognize sounds in the womb. These are people, they must be given the same basic dignities as anyone else.\"\nFollowing the overturning of Roe v. Wade, South Dakota became one of the first states to enact trigger laws banning abortions. Noem defended South Dakota's abortion ban, which only allows exceptions in cases in which the mother's life is in danger. When asked about the case of the 10-year-old child abuse victim who traveled from Ohio to Indiana to receive an abortion, Noem said she would not support changing the law to allow exceptions for rape victims, explaining that she did not \"believe a tragic situation should be perpetuated by another tragedy\".\nNoem proclaimed 2024 the \"Freedom for Life Year\", promoting anti-abortion laws. In April 2024, she announced that she had reversed her support for a federal ban on abortion, saying she believed abortion law should be determined at the state level, and continued to support South Dakota's law banning abortion except to save the life of the pregnant patient, without exceptions for rape or incest.\n\n\n==== Early childhood education ====\nNoem is a vocal opponent of subsidized child care. Her administration rejected $7.5 million in federal funding for free summer meal programs for low-income residents and defeated multiple attempts to provide school lunches for eligible students. In 2023, Noem said, \"I just don't think it's the government's job to pay or to raise people's children for them\".\n\n\n==== Access to public records ====\nWhile running for governor in 2018, Noem made government transparency part of her platform. In her first State of the State address she pledged to \"work toward building the most transparent administration South Dakota has ever seen\".\nThroughout her tenure, news outlets and government transparency advocates sued Noem for failing to provide the transparency she advocated. Complaints included denial of immediate access to a state-funded report about the alleged presence of critical race theory and \"divisive concepts\" in South Dakota schools; denial of access to pardon records; not releasing the cost of the governor's security team; whipping votes against a bill to make public records of the cost of the governor's security; and attempts to seal records on an ethics investigation involving her daughter.\n\n\n==== Anti-protest legislation ====\nIn response to protests against the Keystone Pipeline, Noem's office collaborated with the energy company TransCanada Corporation to develop anti-protest legislation, which Noem signed into law in 2019. The law created a fund to cover the costs of policing pipeline protests. Another law was passed to raise revenue for the fund by creating civil penalties for advising, directing, or encouraging participation in rioting. The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation banned Noem from their grounds as a result. The Indigenous Environmental Network, Sierra Club, and other groups challenged the laws in suits, arguing that they violated First Amendment rights by incentivizing the state to sue protesters. In 2020, after a federal court struck down sections of the legislation as unconstitutional, Noem brought legislation to repeal sections of the previous bill and clarify the definition of \"incitement to riot\".\n\n\n==== China ====\nNoem has called China \"an enemy\" of the U.S. In 2022, she issued an order banning TikTok from state-owned devices, saying the \"Chinese Communist Party uses information it gathers on TikTok to manipulate the American people\". In 2023, she signed an order prohibiting the downloading or use of any application or visiting of any site owned by the Chinese company Tencent, including WeChat, on state-owned devices. In 2024, she signed a bill prohibiting the governments of six countries—China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Venezuela—and entities from those countries from buying agricultural land in South Dakota.\n\n\n==== Conflict of interest action to professionally benefit daughter ====\nIn 2020, after Noem's 26-year-old daughter, Kassidy Peters, was denied a real estate appraisal license, Noem summoned to her office Sherry Bren, a state employee who had directed South Dakota's Appraiser Certification Program for 30 years. Attendees included Peters, Noem's chief of staff Tony Venhuizen, Department of Labor Attorney Amber Mulder and Labor Secretary Marcia Hultman.\nBy telephone, the group was joined by the governor's general counsel, Tom Hart, and a lawyer from the state's Department of Labor and Regulation, Graham Oey. A week later, Hultman demanded Bren's resignation. Bren repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, tried to resolve the issues short of resigning, eventually filing an age discrimination complaint. She received a $200,000 settlement as part of a nondisclosure agreement to withdraw her complaint and leave her position. Noem's spokesperson characterized the allegations as an example of how Noem cut through \"bureaucratic red tape\".\nAfter the Associated Press published a story about the incident, the State Senate's Government Operations and Audit Committee was delegated to investigate. In October 2021, the Committee invited Hultman and Bren to come before it to discuss the appraisal program in light of the controversy. On December 14, 2021, Bren testified before the Government Operations and Audit Committee. She said that Peters received an Agreed Disposition around March/April 2020. Around July 20, 2020, Peters received a letter and/or Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law when she failed to meet the requirements of the Agreed Disposition. Bren said that on July 26, Department of Labor attorney Amber Mulder told her to be prepared to discuss \"what is the definition of a serious deficiency; what criteria do you use for denials; how many are denied each year; how many are approved; are we saying that Kassidy can take certain classes and resubmit\".\nBren said she felt \"very nervous\" and \"intimidated\" when meeting with Noem and attorneys and Labor Secretary Hultman. Bren mentioned during the meeting at the mansion some appraisal classes that she thought would be helpful to Peters. Bren said that Noem was upset that she was just now hearing about the classes. Bren testified that the decision to depart from recognized upgrade procedures and offer a third opportunity would be Hultman's. Bren said this was beyond the recognized procedures and \"not normal.\"\nOn November 1, 2021, the Government Accountability Board set an agenda to discuss this issue and another issue based on complaints brought by Ravnsborg. On December 15, 2021, the Government Accountability Board referred one of the two complaints to Noem for a response and sent the other back to the complainant for further information. On February 3, 2022, the Government Accountability Board referred the second complaint to Noem for a response and gave her until April 15, 2022, to answer both pending complaints.\nOn February 24, 2022, Republican State Representative John Mills introduced House Resolution 7004, \"Addressing the Governor's unacceptable actions in matters related to the appraiser certification program\", against Noem. On March 1, the resolution was debated and failed by a margin of 29 to 38 with three excused, including Noem's primary opponent Steven Haugaard and U.S. House candidate Taffy Howard.\n\n\n==== Conflict with Native American tribes ====\nIn 2024, it was reported that all nine tribes of South Dakota banned Noem from entering any tribal lands, prohibiting her from entering almost 20% of South Dakota. Other media reported that one of the nine tribes, the Yankton Sioux, had not officially banned Noem. The Oglala Sioux banned Noem in February, followed by the Cheyenne River Sioux, the Standing Rock Sioux, and the Rosebud Sioux in April, and the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, the Crow Creek Sioux, and the Flandreau Santee Sioux in May.\nThe tribes took action after demanding that Noem apologize for her comments about them. In January 2024, Noem said that an \"invasion is coming over the southern border\" of the United States, and the \"enemy is the Mexican drug cartels\", which are \"perpetrating violence in each of our states, even here in South Dakota ... The cartels are using our reservations to facilitate the spread of drugs throughout the Midwest.\" In March 2024, Noem said there were \"some tribal leaders that I believe are personally benefiting from the cartels being there\", but gave no evidence, and that there were people \"who actually live in those situations, who call me and text me every day and say, 'Please, dear governor, please come help us in Pine Ridge. We are scared.'\" She added: \"they live with 80% to 90% unemployment. Their kids don't have any hope. They don't have parents who show up and help them.\"\nAround January 2025, Noem apologized to the tribes for the misunderstanding between them, and the Flandreau Santee Sioux tribe dissolved its order banning Noem from its land. The tribe said, \"the Governor has shown us that she is committed to protecting the people of South Dakota including the citizens of the nine Tribal Nations, who share mutual borders with the state\", and expressed its support for her nomination as the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n\n==== COVID-19 pandemic ====\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in South Dakota, Noem initially supported some containment measures before adopting a largely hands‑off approach. In November 2020, she used pandemic relief funds to promote tourism during a surge in cases. She was one of few governors who did not maintain statewide stay-at-home orders or mask mandates; her response broadly mirrored Donald Trump’s approach, and she was given a speaking slot at the 2020 Republican National Convention, which raised her national profile.\nEarly in the pandemic, Noem asked the legislature to give the state health secretary and county officials authority to close businesses; the House rejected the bill. On March 13, 2020, she ordered K‑12 schools to close, and on April 6 she extended that order for the rest of the school year; she also directed businesses and local governments to follow CDC social‑distancing guidance.\nNoem emphasized South Dakota's role in evaluating hydroxychloroquine, which was later found to be ineffective against COVID‑19 and to cause fatal cardiac arrhythmia.\nIn early 2020, one of the largest COVID outbreaks in the US occurred in South Dakota. The Smithfield Foods plant in Sioux Falls reported four deaths and nearly 1,300 infections among workers and family members. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar told legislators that infections were likely due to workers' \"home and social\" habits; on April 13, Noem said, \"We believe that 99 percent of what's going on today wasn't happening inside\" the plant. The Food Safety and Inspection Service initially did not give inspectors PPE and discouraged masks. It later permitted and then supplied them. Noem said the plant was operating as an essential facility; 48 workers were hospitalized.\nNoem did not mandate social distancing or mask‑wearing at the July 3, 2020, event at Mount Rushmore with Trump present; health experts warned that large, unmasked gatherings posed risks. She publicly doubted mask effectiveness, citing the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons in a Rapid City Journal opinion piece; the group has promoted pseudoscience and likened vaccination to \"human experimentation\".\nCOVID cases rose sharply after the 2020 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, in which Noem participated; hospitalizations reached a then‑record 355 on October 22 (75 in ICUs). Health systems postponed elective procedures and urged masking; Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken told residents, \"Wear a dang mask.\"\nSixteen weeks after Trump's 2020 executive order providing a $300 weekly unemployment supplement, Noem declined the money, citing low unemployment; South Dakota was the only state to do so. The jobless rate in June was 7.2%, up from 3.1% in March and down from 11% in April.\nFrom 2020 to 2021, the following events took place:\n\nNoem supported the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in August 2020; nearly 500,000 bikers attended.\nIn September 2020, amid a surge of new cases, Noem announced $5 million of relief funding for a state tourism campaign, including $819,000 for a 30‑second Fox News commercial narrated during the RNC.\nAlso in September 2020, over 550 students were infected at South Dakota universities; 200 more cases were reported in K–12 schools.\nIn October 2020, as South Dakota recorded one of the highest per‑capita case rates and hospitals prioritized severe cases, Noem attributed higher case numbers to increased testing, despite rising positivity and hospitalizations.\nIn February 2021, Noem signed a bill limiting civil liability for certain COVID‑19 exposures, exempting businesses (including PPE sellers) unless exposure resulted from gross negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct.\nAlso in February 2021, she opposed a bill prohibiting schools and universities from requiring student vaccinations; in May she signed an order barring government facilities from requiring proof of vaccination for services, calling such requirements \"un‑American\".\nIn August 2021, Noem opposed legislation proposed by Republican legislators Jon Hansen and Scott Odenbach to prohibit businesses from requiring vaccinations as a condition of employment.\nIn July 2021, she criticized other Republican governors for enacting mandatory measures and \"rewriting history\", arguing that South Dakota had addressed the pandemic by testing and isolating cases; at the time, the state had a high per‑capita death and case rate.\n\n\n==== Department of Corrections ====\nIn July 2021, Noem placed Secretary of the Department of Corrections Mike Liedholt on administrative leave, and fired South Dakota State Penitentiary Warden Darin Young and Deputy Warden Jennifer Dreiske, after receiving an anonymous note with complaints regarding pay, medical coverage and instances of sexual harassment. Liedholt later announced his retirement. Later that month, after meeting with prison employees, despite lingering COVID-19 cases, Noem ended the prison's mask mandate.\nIn August 2021, Noem announced that the CGL Group, a California-based company, was hired for $166,410 to comprehensively review the Department of Corrections operations. At the same time, the director of the prison work program was fired, and two other DOC employees relieved of their duties.\nThe prison work program director, Stephany Bawek, subsequently filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that she was retaliated against for reporting sexual harassment by Young. On March 14, 2022, Bawek filed a lawsuit in federal district court alleging that she was fired for reporting incidents of sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\n\n==== Deployment of South Dakota National Guard to southern border (2021) ====\nIn June 2021, Noem announced that she was sending members of the South Dakota National Guard to Texas's border with Mexico. Tennessee billionaire Willis Johnson said he would donate the money necessary for the deployment. On September 22, 2021, the Center for Public Integrity sued the South Dakota National Guard and the U.S. Department of Defense in the federal district court in the District of Columbia to obtain documents about the deployment and the donation. The 2022 National Defense Authorization Act banned National Guard members from crossing state borders to perform duties paid for by private donors.\n\n\n==== Fireworks at Mount Rushmore lawsuit (2021) ====\nIn 2021, Noem sued U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, seeking to have fireworks at Mount Rushmore for Independence Day. Fireworks displays had been halted at the site in 2009 by the National Park Service due to fire risks and other reasons. Noem hired the private Washington D.C. law firm Consovoy McCarthy to bring the case, with South Dakota state taxpayer money paying for the suit. The U.S. District Court dismissed the suit, with Judge Roberto Lange finding that four of the five reasons given by the NPS and Secretary Haaland were valid. On July 13, Noem filed an appeal with the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.\nOn March 14, 2022, the National Park Service again denied Noem's application for a permit to have fireworks at Mount Rushmore for the 4th of July, citing opposition from Native American groups and the possibility of wildfires.\n\n\n==== Governor's mansion spending ====\nIn May 2019, Noem proposed to build a fence around the governor's mansion, estimated to cost approximately $400,000, but retracted the proposal. In 2020, the 2019 project was revived; a senior Noem advisor told the media that the decision was based on the recommendations of Noem's security team. In late November 2021, it was reported that Noem spent $68,000 of taxpayer dollars on imported rugs from India, chandeliers and a sauna for the mansion.\n\n\n==== Guns ====\n\nIn 2019, Noem signed a bill into law abolishing South Dakota's permit requirement to carry a concealed handgun. In 2022, she sought to build a gun range in Meade County with government funds, but the legislature rejected it.\nAt a 2023 NRA forum in Indiana, Noem said that her two-year-old granddaughter had a shotgun, a rifle, and a \"little pony named Sparkles\".\n\n\n==== LGBTQ rights ====\nNoem opposes same-sex marriage. In 2015, she said she disagreed with Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court's ruling that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional.\nOn March 8, 2021, Noem announced on Twitter that she would sign into law H.B. 1217, the Women's Fairness in Sports Bill, which bans transgender athletes from playing on or against women's school and college sports teams. Some critics of the bill said they were worried it might turn away business and cost the state money. On March 19, Noem issued a style and form veto to H.B. 1217 that substantially altered the bill, not just correcting grammar and spelling mistakes. She defended her position on Tucker Carlson Tonight.\nOn March 29, the South Dakota House rejected Noem's veto, 67–2. The bill was returned to Noem for reconsideration, and she vetoed it again. The House failed to override her veto, by a vote of 45–24. 47 votes were needed to override. Many conservative commentators criticized Noem for vetoing the bill.\nIn December 2021, Noem and her office signaled their support for a bill called \"An Act to Protect Fairness in women's sports.\" The bill would require young athletes to join teams that align with their sex assigned at birth.\nIn 2021, Noem signed a religious refusal bill into law. The legislation amended the state RFRA to allow business owners to cite religious beliefs as a basis to deny products or services to people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The legislation, S.B. 124, was criticized by civil rights groups who said it would enable discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, women, and members of minority faiths. This bill was the first major state RFRA law signed into law in six years, and resembles the 2015 bill signed into law by Indiana Governor Mike Pence.\n\n\n==== \"Meth. We're on It\" campaign ====\nOn November 18, 2019, Noem released a meth awareness campaign named \"Meth. We're on It\". The campaign was widely mocked and Noem was criticized for spending $449,000 of public funds while hiring an out-of-state advertising agency from Minnesota to lead the project. She defended the campaign as successful in raising awareness.\n\n\n==== Opposition to cannabis legalization ====\nIn 2020, Noem opposed two ballot measures to legalize cannabis for medical use and recreational use in South Dakota, saying, \"The fact is, I've never met someone who got smarter from smoking pot. It's not good for our kids. And it's not going to improve our communities.\" After both measures passed, she and two police officers filed a lawsuit seeking a court decision against the measure legalizing recreational use, Amendment A.\nOn February 8, 2021, circuit court judge Christina Klinger struck down the amendment as unconstitutional. After the ruling, she also sought to delay the implementation of the medical marijuana initiative for a year. Ultimately, her efforts failed and medical marijuana became legal on July 1, 2021.\nNoem has opposed the cultivation of industrial hemp, vetoing a bill that passed the South Dakota House and Senate in 2019 to legalize hemp cultivation. She said, \"There is no question in my mind that normalizing hemp, like legalizing medical marijuana, is part of a larger strategy to undermine enforcement of the drug laws and make legalized marijuana inevitable.\"\n\n\n==== RV park in Custer State Park proposal ====\nIn 2022, Noem sought to locate a government-paid RV park in Custer State Park. The proposal was met with significant opposition to include government competing with private business and disturbing the pristine nature of the park. The House Agricultural and Natural Resources deferred the bill to the 41st day, effectively killing it, by a vote of 9–3.\n\n\n==== School prayer bill ====\nIn 2022, Noem sought to have prayer put back in school after mentioning it in a speech in Iowa. On January 21, 2022, the \"prayer bill\", HB 1015, was defeated in the House Education Committee by a vote of 9–6. An aide to Noem admitted to the committee that no schools were consulted about the proposal.\n\n\n==== Staff ====\nOn November 19, 2021, Noem named her fifth chief of staff, Mark Miller, to replace outgoing chief of staff Aaron Scheibe. Scheibe served as chief of staff from May 1 to November 19, 2021. Tony Venhuizen preceded Scheibe from March 2, 2020, to April 23, 2021. Josh Shields preceded Venhuizen from October 1, 2019, to January 1, 2020. Herb Jones was Noem's first chief of staff, and served from January 5 to October 1, 2019.\n\n\n==== Trade ====\nIn February 2019, she said that the Trump administration's trade wars with China and the European Union had devastated South Dakota's economy, particularly the agricultural sector, \"by far\" the state's largest industry.\n\n\n==== Supplemental income from political donations ====\nIn 2023, while serving as South Dakota's governor, Noem funneled $80,000 in fees from a nonprofit, American Resolve Policy Fund, into her personal company. She failed to disclose this payment in her federal ethics filings upon joining DHS, which ethics experts say violates disclosure rules.\n\n\n== Secretary of Homeland Security (2025–present) ==\n\n\n=== Nomination and confirmation ===\nOn November 12, 2024, President-elect Trump selected Noem to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security in his second term. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a confirmation hearing for her on January 17, 2025. The committee advanced her nomination in a 13–2 vote on January 20. On January 25, the Senate confirmed Noem by a vote of 59–34, with seven Democrats voting to confirm.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\n\nAfter resigning as governor of South Dakota, Noem was sworn in on January 25, 2025, by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as Secretary of Homeland Security, with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry holding the Bible.\nIn the early morning of January 28, Noem joined multiple federal law enforcement agencies, including United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), to lead a raid on undocumented immigrants in New York City. Her department posted a video of the raid on X that showed an apparent arrest.\nAfter the 2025 Potomac River mid-air collision, Noem deployed U.S. Coast Guard resources for search and rescue efforts.\n\nOne of Noem's first acts in office was to rescind an 18-month extension of temporary protected status for about 600,000 Venezuelans who had fled Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime. In March, she revoked legal protections for 532,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who had settled in the U.S. since 2022.\nIn February, CNN host Dana Bash interviewed Noem about the new administration's policies and the Department of Homeland Security, including the use of Guantanamo Bay to detain migrants, which Noem said would be temporary. Noem also told Bash that she was comfortable with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) having access to sensitive data, saying that it was identifying waste, fraud, and abuse. She added, \"information he [Elon Musk] has is looking at programs, not focusing on personal data and information.\"\nIn April, The Washington Post reported that Noem and acting Social Security Administration commissioner Leland Dudek had instructed the Social Security Administration to falsely list over 6,000 living immigrants in its database of dead people.\nOn the evening of April 20, 2025, Noem's purse was stolen from a D.C. burger restaurant. The purse contained important items, like her government access badge, apartment keys, $2,000–3,000 in cash, her passport, and blank checks. The incident raised various concerns, including about her Secret Service detail presence.\nThe Trump administration has claimed that around 140,000 people had been deported as of April 2025, though some estimates put the number at roughly half that.\nDuring a May 20 Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the Department of Homeland Security's budget for fiscal year 2026, Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus as \"a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country\" in response to a question from Senator Maggie Hassan. In actuality, habeas corpus is the constitutional right for a detainee to request that a court review the lawfulness of their detention, which would require the government to justify the detention. After being corrected on the definition, Noem said that the American president \"has the authority under the Constitution to\" choose to suspend habeas corpus. In fact, the constitutional clause on the suspension of habeas corpus, which reads \"Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it\", is in Article One of the United States Constitution on the powers of Congress, not Article Two of the United States Constitution on the powers of the executive branch.\n\nOn May 22, Noem attempted to revoke the Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification for Harvard University (see Education policy of the second Donald Trump administration).\nDuring a news conference in Los Angeles on June 12, Noem failed to recognize the senior U.S. Senator from California, Alex Padilla, who was present at the news conference. When Padilla attempted to ask Noem a question, he was forcibly removed from the room, pushed to the ground, and handcuffed by FBI and Secret Service agents.\nIn June 2025, ProPublica reported that Noem failed to disclose past income from a dark money group in her federal ethics filings upon joining DHS, which ethics experts say violates disclosure rules. In November, ProPublica announced that a firm tied to Noem had received $200 million in DHS ad contracts during the government shutdown. The firm, Strategy Group, has multiple ties with Noem and her political career.\nNoem has been nicknamed \"ICE Barbie\" because of her frequent photo ops with ICE at its raids.\nIn August 2025, Noem announced that 1.6 million unauthorized immigrants had left the United States since January of that year.\n\n\n=== Deportation of U.S. service members and veterans ===\nDuring a December 12, 2025, committee hearing, U.S. Representative Seth Magaziner asked Noem how many U.S. veterans DHS had deported. She replied that they had not deported any. He then showed, via Zoom, Purple Heart recipient and green-card holder Sae Joon Park, who had been deported under her administration. Magaziner said Park had \"sacrificed more for this country than most people ever have.\"\nPark legally immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea when he was 7, grew up in Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, and enlisted in the U.S. Army after graduating from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks in 1988. He was deployed to Panama in 1989 during Operation Just Cause and wounded by enemy gunfire. After leaving the Army, Park suffered from PTSD, and his family's business burned to the ground during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. He moved to Hawaii and in 2009 was arrested for attempting to buy cocaine. Federal authorities allowed Park to stay in the U.S. as long as he made regular check-ins, which he did until June 2025, when he was told to self-deport or be deported by DHS officials. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Park had an \"extensive criminal history\" and had been given a final removal order, with the option to self-deport. Representative Delia Ramirez has since called for Noem to resign or be impeached due to her statements to Congress and wants a Congressional investigation into possible violations.\n\n\n=== Impeachment proceedings ===\nOn January 14, 2026, Representative Robin Kelly introduced three articles of impeachment against Noem. She alleged Noem had obstructed congressional oversight of ICE facilities; violated public trust regarding arrests and the use of force; and engaged in self-dealing by awarding the contract for a $200 million taxpayer-funded recruitment campaign to the husband of Tricia McLaughlin. As of the filing, 70 representatives had signaled their support for the proceedings.\n\n\n=== Criticism over use of Coast Guard resources ===\nThe Coast Guard have stated that several of Sec. Noem's actions and directives have caused strain between the USCG and the DHS, especially downgrading search and rescue, a core USCG mission to secondary to ICE deportation missions. This began in February 2025 when Noem told the National Command Center to divert a USCG C-130 Hercules from a search and rescue mission for a 23-year-old coast guardsman who had gone overboard. The USCG commander in San Diego was able to send two C-27 Spartans to Texas for the deportation mission and keep the C-130 on the search.  The DHS has denied that they ordered the aircraft to suspend the search. During Noem's tenure more than 750 USCG flights have been redirected to deportation missions.\nNoem's advisor, Corey Lewandowski also fired a USCG pilot during a mission because Noem's blanket had been left on another aircraft. DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin denied that the incident took place.\nNoem has also been criticized for living in the Coast Guard Commandant's residence at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling rent-free. DHS officials claimed that Noem is paying fair market value for the temporary use of the residence, but failed to provide documentation.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== Presidential politics ==\n\n\n=== 2020 presidential election ===\nIn 2020, the Trump-Pence ticket carried South Dakota, receiving 261,043 votes to 150,471 for the Biden-Harris ticket.  Noem was initially designated to be one of Trump's three presidential electors for South Dakota, but later withdrew.\nNoem has claimed that the 2020 presidential election, in which Biden defeated Trump, was marred by widespread voter fraud; no evidence supports this claim. On December 8, 2020, Noem tacitly acknowledged the outcome of the election when she referred to a \"Biden administration\" during her annual state budget address, but even after Biden was inaugurated in January, she still refused to accept that the election was \"free and fair\".\nAfter the U.S. Capitol was attacked by a pro-Trump mob on January 6, 2021, disrupting the counting of the electoral votes formalizing Biden's victory, Noem spoke out against the violence, saying: \"We are all entitled to peacefully protest. Violence is not a part of that.\" One day after calling for peace and reconciliation in the aftermath of the assault on the Capitol, Noem called the two newly elected Democratic senators from Georgia, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, \"communists\" in an op-ed for The Federalist, prompting criticism from South Dakota Democrats.\n\n\n=== 2024 presidential election ===\nNoem endorsed Trump in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries in September 2023, at a rally hosted for him in Rapid City, South Dakota. Trump invited her to appear with him at a March 2024 rally in Vandalia, Ohio.\nDuring Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, commentators suggested that Noem was a potential running mate for Trump. In September 2023, when asked on Newsmax if she would agree to serve as Trump's running mate, Noem responded that she would \"in a heartbeat\". At the February 2024 CPAC conference, Noem tied with Vivek Ramaswamy as attendees' top choice for Trump's running mate, with each receiving 15% of the vote in a straw poll. Also that month, Trump acknowledged that Noem was one of the names on his shortlist to be his running mate. In March 2024, CNN reported that Noem was one of four people Trump had shown increased interest in selecting as his running mate.\nIn April 2024, insiders said that her odds of being selected as Trump's running mate had waned due to her stance on abortion and the revelation in her book No Going Back that she shot and killed her pet dog and a goat. It was noted that \"additions, subtractions and the emergence of dark-horse candidates remain possible\", but on June 5, NBC News reported that Noem was no longer on Trump's shortlist of running mates.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe married Bryon Noem in 1992, in Watertown, South Dakota. They have three children. In 2011, when Noem moved to Washington, D.C. to take her congressional office, her family continued to live on a ranch near Castlewood, South Dakota.\nNoem is a Protestant. As of 2018, her family attended a Foursquare Church in Watertown. She is a grandmother.\nIn September 2021, conservative media outlet American Greatness reported that Noem was having an extramarital affair with political operative Corey Lewandowski. Noem called the report a \"disgusting lie\", saying, \"these old, tired attacks on conservative women are based on a falsehood that we can't achieve anything without a man's help.\" In September 2023, the New York Post and the Daily Mail published similar reports about Noem and Lewandowski, which Noem's spokesman denied. In September 2025, New York reported that the romantic relationship between Noem and Lewandowski is ongoing, and that Lewandowski plays a significant role in running the Department of Homeland Security, acting as Noem's \"de facto chief of staff\".\nIn March 2024, Noem shared a video in which she identified herself as the South Dakota governor and promoted a cosmetic dentist business that she said helped her after she lost her front teeth in a biking accident years before: \"I love my new family at Smile Texas!\" Noem has since become one of the most prominent examples of so-called \"Mar-a-Lago face\", a cosmetic surgery trend among conservative women, also known as \"Republican makeup\".\nIn August 2024, Noem and her sister, Cindy Grantham, were inducted into the Daughters of the American Revolution by State Regent Katherine Tarrell at the South Dakota State Fair.\n\n\n=== No Going Back ===\nIn April 2024, pre-release excerpts of Noem's second autobiography, No Going Back, received broad criticism and condemnation. In a chapter titled \"Bad Day to Be a Goat\", Noem recounts that she brought her family's 14-month-old female wirehaired pointer, Cricket, along for a pheasant hunt with guests at her family's hunting lodge. Expecting Cricket to emulate the older, trained, dogs on the hunt, Noem instead felt that Cricket ruined the hunt by \"chasing all those birds and having the time of her life\". After the dog killed several chickens on the same day, Noem decided Cricket was \"dangerous\" and \"untrainable\", and shot the dog dead in a gravel pit. Noem then killed her family's male goat, which she said was \"disgusting, musky, rancid\".\nNoem initially responded that \"tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm\", and subsequently said the incident occurred 20 years ago, and that \"the fake news ... put the worst spin\" on the story, as Cricket was a \"working dog\" that \"came to us from a family who had found her way too aggressive ... a responsible owner does what they need to do\". The story led to bipartisan criticism of Noem and doubt about the likelihood of her selection as Trump's vice presidential running mate intensified. A fundraising dinner for Noem in Colorado scheduled for May 4 was canceled after the group and the hotel hosting the event received death threats.\nLater in the memoir, Noem wrote of imagining herself becoming president in 2025, taking over from Biden, and that the first thing she would do would be to \"make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds ('Commander, say hello to Cricket for me')\", in an apparent suggestion that Commander be killed. Months earlier, Commander had been moved out of the White House after having bitten Secret Service agents and others on over a dozen occasions. In an interview, Noem said that Biden was \"accountable\" and called for Biden to \"make a decision\" on \"what to do\" about Commander.\nNoem also wrote, \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I'd been a children's pastor, after all", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:11:36Z"}
{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "338810", "title": "Cavalier King Charles Spaniel", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_King_Charles_Spaniel", "content_length": 23336, "text": "The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) is a British breed of toy dog of spaniel type. Four colours are recognised: Blenheim (chestnut and white), tricolour (black/white/tan), black and tan, and ruby; the coat is smooth and silky. The lifespan is usually between eight and twelve years.\nThe Cavalier King Charles changed dramatically in the late seventeenth century, when it was inter-bred with flat-nosed breeds. Until the 1920s, it shared the same history as the smaller King Charles Spaniel. Breeders attempted to recreate what they considered to be the original configuration – a dog resembling Charles II's spaniel of the English Civil War period, when supporters of the king were known as Cavaliers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDuring the early part of the 18th century, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting. The duke recorded that they were able to keep up with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.\nAttempts were made to recreate the original Cavalier King Charles Spaniel as early as the turn of the 20th century, using the now extinct Toy Trawler Spaniels. These attempts were documented by Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, in the book \"Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors Including the History And Management of Toy Spaniels, Pekingese, Japanese and Pomeranians\" published under the name of the \"Hon. Mrs. Neville Lytton\" in 1911.\n\n\n=== Divergence from King Charles Spaniel ===\nIn 1926, the American Roswell Eldridge offered a dog show class prize of 25 pounds of sterling silver each as a prize for the best male and females of \"Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in pictures of Charles II of England's time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull.\" The breeders of the era were appalled, although several entered what they considered to be sub-par Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in the competition. Eldridge died before seeing his plan come to fruition, but several breeders believed in what he said and in 1928 the first Cavalier club was formed. The first standard was created, based on a dog named \"Ann's Son\" owned by Mostyn Walker, and the Kennel Club recognised the variety as \"King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type\".\nThe Second World War caused a drastic setback to the emerging breed, with the vast majority of breeding stock destroyed because of wartime hardship and food shortages. For instance, in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel, the population of 60 dogs dropped to three during the 1940s. Following the war, few dogs survived as the new beginning from which all present-day Cavaliers descend. And in 1945, the Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.\nThe first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown who, together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts, founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA that continues to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created by a group of breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club. It was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1995, and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers. Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United States and ranks as the 13th most popular pure-breed in the United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nHistorically the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was a lap dog and is small for a spaniel, with fully grown adults comparable in size to adolescents of other larger spaniel breeds. The tail is usually not docked, and the Cavalier should have a silky coat of moderate length. Standards state that it should be free from curl, although a slight wave is allowed. Feathering can grow on their ears, feet, legs and tail in adulthood. Standards require this be kept long, with the feathering on the feet a particularly important aspect of the breed's features.\nThe Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the English Toy Spaniel can often be confused with each other. In the United Kingdom, the English Toy Spaniel is called the King Charles Spaniel, while in the United States, one of the colours of the Toy Spaniel is known as King Charles. The two breeds share similar history and only diverged from each other about 100 years ago. There are several major differences between the two breeds, with the primary difference being size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between 13 and 18 pounds (5.9 and 8.2 kg), the King Charles is smaller at 9 to 15 pounds (4.1 to 6.8 kg). In addition, their facial features, while similar, are different; the Cavalier's ears are set higher and its skull is flat, while the King Charles's skull is domed. Finally, the muzzle length of the Cavalier tends to be longer than that of its King Charles cousin.\n\n\n=== Colour ===\n\nThe breed has four recognized colours. Cavaliers that have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background are known as Blenheim in honor of Blenheim Palace, where John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough raised for assistance in hunting the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour. In some Blenheim dogs there is a chestnut spot in the middle of the forehead: this is called the \"Blenheim\" spot. The Blenheim spot is also known as the mark of the \"Duchess Thumb Print\", based on the legend that Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough while awaiting news of her husband's safe return from the Battle of Blenheim, pressed the head of an expecting dam with her thumb, resulting in five puppies bearing the lucky mark after news that the battle had been won.\nBlack and Tan are dogs with black bodies with tan highlights, particularly eyebrows, cheeks, legs and beneath the tail. Black and Tan is referred to as \"King Charles\" in the King Charles Spaniel.\nRuby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut, although some can have some white in their coats that is considered a fault under American Kennel Club conformation show rules.\nThe fourth colour is known as Tricolour, which is black and white with tan markings on cheeks, inside ears, on eyebrows, inside legs, and on underside of tail. This colour is referred to as \"Prince Charles\" in the King Charles Spaniel.\n\n\n=== Popularity ===\nAccording to statistics released by The Kennel Club, Cavaliers were the 6th most popular dog in the United Kingdom in 2007 with 11,422 registrations in a single year. Their popularity is on the rise in America; in 1998 they were the 56th most popular breed but in both 2007 and 2008 they were the 25th most popular. They ranked higher in some individual US cities in the 2008 statistics: 8th in both Nashville and Minneapolis-St.Paul, 7th in Boston, Atlanta and Washington D.C., and 6th in both New York City and San Francisco. The breed's popularity has continued to grow, ranking in 14th place in 2022.\nIn 2009, the Cavalier was the 4th most popular breed in Australia with 3,196 registrations, behind only Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherd Dogs and Staffordshire Bull Terriers. In addition, there are also national breed clubs in Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. Today, Cavaliers are becoming a popular choice in cross breeding and are bred with other dogs such as poodles, though it should be acknowledged that these breeds are not purebred dogs eligible for registration under the AKC.\nCavaliers were among the pets of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, known for his Blenheim Cavalier named Rex. Cavaliers were also the dog of choice for Queen Victoria.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe breed is highly affectionate, playful, extremely patient and eager to please. As such, dogs of the breed are good with children and other dogs. Cavaliers are not shy about socialising with much larger dogs. They will adapt quickly to almost any environment, family, and location and suit city and country life. Their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs makes them ideal in houses with more than one breed of dog as long as the other dog is trained. Cavaliers rank 44th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average intelligence in working or obedience. Cavaliers are naturally curious and playful, but also enjoy simply cuddling up on a cushion or lap, making them excellent companion or lap dogs for medical patients and the elderly.\nCavaliers are active and sporting. Cavaliers are successful in conformation shows, obedience and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures. The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise, happy with either sleeping on the couch or taking long walks.\n\nThey have an instinct to chase most things that move including vehicles on busy streets, and so most Cavaliers will never become \"street-wise\". As they tend to regard all strangers as friends, members of the breed will usually not make good guard dogs. Spaniels have a strong hunting instinct and may endanger birds and small animals. However, owners have reported that through training their Cavaliers live happily with a variety of small animals including hamsters and gerbils.\nThe Cavalier's coat requires weekly brushing, but no trimming. However, some owners prefer to trim their Cavalier's long feathers and slippers that can become very dirty when walking or playing outside.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nA 2022 UK study of veterinary data found a life expectancy of 10.45 years compared to 11.82 for crossbreeds. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 11.8 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.\nA 2018 Japanese study of pet cemetery data found a life expectancy of 13.1 years compared to 15.1 for crossbreeds and 13.7 overall. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 10 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall. A 2005 Swedish study of insurance records found 48% of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels died by the age of 10, higher than the overall rate at 35% of dogs dying by the age of 10.\nCavaliers can notably be prone to mitral valve disease, which leads to heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers at some point in their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, including early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. Additionally, bad breeding increases the chance that a Cavalier will develop MVD, so it is important to find a responsible breeder who uses dogs with healthy hearts. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia. Cavaliers are also affected by ear problems, a common health problem among spaniels of various types, and they can have such other general conditions as hip dysplasia, which are common across many types of dog breeds.\nIn 2022, the Oslo District Court banned the breeding of Cavalier King Charles spaniels in Norway due to their propensity for developing health problems. In its verdict the court judged that no dog of this breed could be considered healthy, therefore using them for breeding would be a violation of Norway's Animal Welfare Act.\n\n\n=== Mitral valve disease ===\n\nNearly all Cavaliers eventually have mitral valve disease, with heart murmurs that may progressively worsen, leading to heart failure. This condition is polygenic (affected by multiple genes), and therefore all lines of Cavaliers worldwide are susceptible. It is the leading cause of death in the breed. A survey by The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom showed that 42.8% of Cavalier deaths are cardiac related. The next most common causes are cancer (12.3%) and old age (12.2%). The condition can begin to emerge at an early age and statistically may be expected to be present in more than half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels by age 5. It is rare for a 10-year-old Cavalier not to have a heart murmur. While heart disease is common in dogs generally – one in 10 of all dogs will eventually have heart problems – mitral valve disease is generally (as in humans) a disease of old age. The \"hinge\" on the heart's mitral valve loosens and can gradually deteriorate, along with the valve's flaps, causing a heart murmur (as blood seeps through the valve between heartbeats) then congestive heart failure. The Cavalier is particularly susceptible to early-onset heart disease, which may be evident in dogs as young as one or two years of age.\nVeterinary geneticists and cardiologists have developed breeding guidelines to eliminate early-onset mitral valve disease in the breed, but it is unclear if a statistically significant number of breeders follow these guidelines. The chairperson of the UK CKCS Club said in 2009: \"There are many members who are still not prepared to health check their breeding stock, and of those who do, it would appear that many would not hesitate to breed from affected animals.\" The MVD breeding protocol recommends that parents should be at least 2.5 years old and heart clear, and their parents (i.e., the puppy's grandparents) should be heart clear until age 5.\n\n\n=== Syringomyelia ===\n\nSyringomyelia (SM) is a condition affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. It is caused by a malformation, commonly known as Chiari malformation, in the lower back of the skull that reduces the space available to the brain, compressing it and often forcing it out (herniating it) through the opening into the spinal cord. This blocks the flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid's pressure, creating turbulence that in turn is believed to create fluid pockets, or syrinxes (hence the term syringomyelia), in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with international research samples in the past few years consistently showing over 90% of Cavaliers have the malformation, and that between 30 and 70% have syrinxes. However, most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic. Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age, they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85% of symptomatic dogs, according to Clare Rusbridge, a research scientist. Symptoms include sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder. Scratching is often unilateral – restricted to one side of the body. Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body (\"air scratching\"). The scratching behaviour appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking – without stopping – in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching (\"bunny hopping\"). Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar, is being walked on a leash, or is excited, and first thing in the morning or at night.\nNot all dogs who show scratching behaviour appear to be in pain, though several leading researchers, including Dr. Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs. Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US, believe scratching in SM Cavaliers is a sign of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the dorsal horn region of the spine. If onset is at an early age, a first sign may be scratching and/or rapidly appearing scoliosis. If the problem is severe, there is likely to be poor proprioception (awareness of body position), especially with regard to the forelimbs. Clumsiness and falling results from this problem. Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of the condition.\nA veterinarian will rule out basic causes of scratching or discomfort such as ear mites, fleas, and allergies, and then, primary secretory otitis media (PSOM – glue ear), as well as spinal or limb injuries, before assuming that a Cavalier has SM. PSOM can present similar symptoms but is much easier and less expensive to treat. Episodic Falling Syndrome can also present similar symptoms. An MRI scan is normally done to confirm diagnosis of SM (and also will reveal PSOM). If a veterinarian suspects SM he or she will recommend an MRI scan. Neurologists give scanned dogs a signed certificate noting its grade.\n\n\n=== Episodic Falling (EF) ===\n\nEpisodic Falling causes \"exercise-induced paroxysmal hypertonicity\" meaning that there is increased muscle tone in the dog and the muscles cannot relax. Previously thought to be a muscular disorder, it is now known to be neurological. EF is caused by a single recessive gene, and a genetic test is available. Except for severe cases, episodes will be in response to exercise, excitement or similar exertions. Although EF is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy, which typically results in loss of consciousness, the dog remains conscious throughout the episode. Severity of symptoms can range from mild, occasional falling to freezing to seizure-like episodes lasting hours. Episodes can become more or less severe as the dog gets older and there is no standard pattern to the attacks. The onset of symptoms usually occurs when a dog is between 4 months and 4 years of age. It is similar to Scotty Cramp, a genetic disorder in Scottish Terriers. About 1% of Cavaliers are affected by the condition, with 19% being carriers. Dogs with whole coloured coats were more likely to be affected than dogs with parti-coloured coats.\n\n\n=== Thrombocytopenia and macrothrombocytopenia ===\nAs many as half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may have a congenital blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements that aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers are the most common cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis is also a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.\n\n\n=== Hip and knee disorders ===\nHip dysplasia is a common genetic disease that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is not present at birth but develops with age. Hip dysplasia is diagnosed by X-rays, but it is not usually evident in X-rays of Cavaliers until they mature. Even in adult spaniels with severe hip dysplasia, X-rays may not always indicate the disease. In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog, Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux.\nCavaliers can be subject to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This condition is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a Cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.\n\n\n=== Eye problems ===\nA disorder commonly found in Cavaliers is keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially known as \"dry eye\". The usual cause of this condition is an autoimmune reaction against the dog's lacrimal gland (tear gland), reducing the production of tears. According to the Canine Inherited Disorders Database, the condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness. This disorder can decrease or heal over time.\nA 1999 study of Cavaliers conducted by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems. They include hereditary cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, microphthalmia, progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal dysplasia.\n\n\n=== Ear disorders ===\nPrimary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), also known as glue ear, consists of a highly viscous mucus plug that fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations in the head and neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers that actually have PSOM and not SM.\n\nCavalier King Charles Spaniels may be predisposed to a form of congenital deafness, which is present at birth, due to a lack of formation or early degeneration of receptors in the inner ear, although this is relatively rare. In addition, more recent studies have found Cavaliers that develop a progressive hearing loss, which usually begins during puppy-hood and progresses until the dog is completely deaf, usually between the ages of three and five years. The progressive nature of this form of deafness in Cavaliers is believed to be caused by degeneration of the hearing nerve rather than the lack of formation or early degeneration of the inner ear receptors.\n\n\n== Urban legend ==\nAn urban legend claims that Charles II issued a special decree granting King Charles Spaniels permission to enter any establishment in the UK, overriding \"no dog except guide dogs\" rules. A variant of this myth relates specifically to the Houses of Parliament. This myth is sometimes instead applied to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.\nThe UK Parliament website states: \"Contrary to popular rumour, there is no Act of Parliament referring to King Charles spaniels being allowed anywhere in the Palace of Westminster. We are often asked this question and have thoroughly researched it.\" Similarly, there is no proof of any such law covering the wider UK. A spokesman for the Kennel Club said: \"This law has been quoted from time to time. It is alleged in books that King Charles made this decree but our research hasn't tracked it down.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nCompanion dog\nCompanion Dog Group\nToy Group\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:11:37Z"}
{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "594262", "title": "Strontium Dog", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium_Dog", "content_length": 41070, "text": "Strontium Dog is a long-running British comics series starring Johnny Alpha, a mutant bounty hunter who lives in Earth's future. The series was created in 1978 by writer John Wagner (under the pseudonym T. B. Grover) and artist Carlos Ezquerra for Starlord, a short-lived weekly science fiction comic. When Starlord was cancelled, the series transferred to the British science fiction weekly 2000 AD. In 1980, Wagner was joined by co-writer Alan Grant, although scripts were normally credited to Grant alone. Grant wrote the series by himself from 1988 to 1990. Wagner revived the series after a ten-year hiatus in 2000. After Ezquerra's death in October 2018, the series was put in indefinite hiatus with no current plans for its continuation (other than some single-episode stories in special issues aimed at younger readers).\nThe series takes place in an imagined future after the Great Nuclear War of 2150. Due to nuclear fallout of strontium-90, humanity has an increased number of mutant births, most of whom have physical abnormalities but some of whom possess superhuman abilities. John Kreelman is born with white blank eyes and a mutant \"alpha radiation\" power that grants him greater perception, allowing telepathy and the ability to see through many surfaces. Facing discrimination, John Kreelman adopts the name \"Johnny Alpha\" and becomes a bounty hunter for the Search/Destroy Agency. Due to the origin of their mutation and their S/D badges, mutant bounty hunters are nicknamed \"strontium dogs.\" A formidable bounty hunter, Johnny Alpha uses not only his mutant abilities in combat but also an array of high-tech gadgets and weapons.\nStrontium Dog stories are often known for a bleak, minimalistic edge at times reminiscent of spaghetti westerns. Several stories veer into satire and overtly bizarre science fantasy. Johnny Alpha's adventures sometimes involve time travel (such as a mission to 1945 where he attempts to apprehend Adolf Hitler) or alternate dimensions (including one that seems to be Hell). On several occasions, Johnny Alpha's time travel adventures to periods before the Great Nuclear War have featured him crossing paths with another 2000 AD character Judge Dredd.\n\n\n== Series background ==\nIn the world of Strontium Dog, the Great Nuclear War of 2150 wipes out 70% of Britain's population, leading to a huge increase of mutant births due to exposure to nuclear fallout (strontium-90). The mutants of Strontium Dog differ from the usual depiction of mutants in American comics, such as those published by Marvel, in that they are generally afflicted with obvious physical abnormalities. Only a rare few are born with superhuman powers. These strontium-influenced mutants face a high degree of prejudice from average humans (\"norms\"). Born in 2150 to Diana Kreelman and her husband Nelson Bunker Kreelman, the boy Johnny Kreelman has mutant eyes that can increase his perception by channeling \"alpha radiation\", allowing telepathy and telekinesis, as well as the ability to see through most surfaces. Nelson is a bigoted politician who gains popularity by drafting anti-mutant laws and creating the anti-mutant police force known as the Kreelers. Despised, abused, and hidden away by his father, Johnny escapes his parents at a young age and adopts the name Johnny Alpha. He then joins the rising resistance group known as the Mutant Army and quickly becomes a valued leader, despite still being a teenager.\nThe Mutant Uprising of 2167 fails to overthrow the government. Despite this, Johnny Alpha blackmails his father, leading to the man's resignation and the disbanding of the Kreelers (though many members simply transfer into the local police force). Members of the Mutant Army are pardoned for their actions only on condition that they leave Earth forever. An orbital space station is built and becomes the headquarters of the new Search/Destroy Agency, an organization that accepts contracts to hunt criminals and threats deemed too dangerous for conventional law enforcement and \"norms.\" The former Mutant Army members become galactic bounty hunters for the S/D Agency. Due to their S/D badges and the origins of their mutations, these bounty hunters are nicknamed \"strontium dogs\" by Earth people. This also leads the S/D orbital base to be nicknamed the Doghouse.\nOn Earth, new laws protect mutants from being hunted and targeted for extermination. However, they still face great prejudice from society and are segregating into ghettos, such as a large mutant settlement at Milton Keynes. Additionally, mutants have limited working opportunities and cannot own  businesses. Several mutants succumb to societal pressures and poverty, while others join the S/D Agency as new bounty hunters. By 2180, Johnny Alpha is one of the most famous strontium dogs.\n\n\n=== Earth ===\nEarth is rarely seen in the strip. When it is, the focus is often New Britain — Great Britain after a devastating nuclear war. It is much closer to modern-day Britain than Judge Dredd's Brit-Cit by the same writers, but it contains areas of nuclear devastation such as the Greater London Crater and Birmingham Gap; areas known to survive include Salisbury (now a major area and political centre), Glasgow, Newcastle, Dover, Christchurch & Bournemouth (now a combined conurbation), Cardiff, Isles of Scilly, and Winchester. The flying building of Upminster contains both the parliament and the monarchy. According to the sequel series Strontium Dogs, Britain has a large empire of outer-space colonies.\nThe mutants of New Britain live in ghettos, isolated from the human population and living in poverty. Stories like Traitor To His Kind reveal some figures in the government, such as the First Lord of the Military (himself having a mutant daughter), make attempts to slowly improve the mutants' situation, but much of this goes unnoticed by the public. Many other figures in the government prefer to regress toward greater oppression or even attempted extermination of the mutant population.\nIreland is known to still exist, though little has been shown; the US and Canada are both visited in The Mork Whisperer (2009); and the leader of a West African Mutant Republic is shown in The Final Solution. Antarctica is the setting of part of Outlaw, shown to have been turned into a tropical area with marshes and rainforests by the Rad Wars. The centre is Antarctic City (also the name of a megacity in Judge Dredd), with military and police matters handled by the Antarctic Militia.\nIn The Final Solution, the government is usurped by the New Church and the incumbent monarch killed. According to the first Strontium Dogs story,  after the destruction of the New Church by the strontium dogs, a hastily assembled junta government exiled all mutants from Britain. Crossroads, in 2000 AD prog 898, reveals that Earth is a severe political mess, with 26 \"minor wars\", and the rest of the galaxy was cutting ties. The later strip The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha ignores all of this, instead having post-Church New Britain ruled by a more liberal government.\n\n\n=== Dating ===\nThe first Strontium Dog stories in Starlord and 2000 AD were said to be set in the year 2180. During the Strontium Dog series published in 2000 AD, in-story events progressed were indicated as occurring in real time to publication. The story \"Max Bubba\" was published five years after the first Strontium Dog story and gave the date 2185 for its events. Similarly, the main Judge Dredd stories progress in parallel to the real time publication dates. Exceptions to this are some stories appearing in annual issues and summer specials that indicate they are revisiting earlier points of Johnny Alpha's life.\nDespite this, there have been some dating discrepancies in the Strontium Dog series. The stories \"The No-Go Job\" and \"The Final Solution\" present a date of 2180 but are said to take place two years after the events in \"Max Bubba.\" Likewise, the story \"Judgement Day\" gives the date 2178 even though it is set after the events in \"Max Bubba.\"\n\n\n== Johnny Alpha ==\nJohn Alpha is the main character of Strontium Dog stories. His mutated eyes allow him to see through walls and read minds. Born in 2150, he is the son of Diana Kreelman and her husband Nelson Bunker Kreelman. Nelson is a politician who drafts the anti-mutant laws and gains power on the back of bigotry, creating the anti-mutant police force known as the Kreelers. Johnny leaves his parents at a young age and joins the Mutant Army, changing his surname from Kreelman to Alpha and deciding to keep his father's identity secret. Johnny becomes one of the Mutant Army's key leaders, playing a major part in the mutant uprising of 2167 when he is only 17.\nBy the time he joins the Search/Destroy agency, Johnny Alpha is a highly skilled and dangerous fighter, adept at combining his mutant powers with hand-to-hand combat and weaponry. A sarcastic, cynical man, he nonetheless believes that innocent life must be protected or avenged, even if against the odds. Deeply loyal to friends, he can be impatient and quick to anger if plans go wrong or situations continue to worsen, but often this motivates him to improvise new solutions rather than simply stew in anger. A dogged bounty hunter determined to earn reward for his work, Johnny is also guided by a moral conscience. He is persistent and pursues a target even if the job becomes difficult. However, he may relent for a good enough reason, such as if his target is a victim of greater evil. If he believes the cause is great enough, he may forego payment or decide not to accept it. In \"The Doc Quince Case\", learning new information convinces him to no longer pursue a man he has been hunting but instead to rescue and help him. In \"The Slavers of Drule\", Johnny tracks down a group of slavers simply because he believes it is the right thing to do. Despite his morality, Johnny is not above vengeance for himself or those he considers family. A device he used on his own father caused Nelson Kreelman to be locked in a time-loop where he continuously relived his final moments, begging for his life.\nDuring the course of his career as a strontium dog, Johnny Alpha becomes a formidable legend and even a hero to some. He is responsible for such legendary achievements as destroying the Wolrog homeworld, leading the mutant uprising on Earth, and bringing Adolf Hitler to the future to face trial. He becomes known for generously assisting mutants in trouble, such as when he donates a large sum of money to the Milton Keynes ghetto in \"Mutie's Luck\".\nAt times, Alpha has encountered another 2000 AD character, Judge Dredd, by journeying into the past via time travel, but it is ambiguous whether Johnny Alpha's future world is the fate of Dredd's timeline or one of several possibilities.\n\n\n=== Weapons/equipment and mutant abilities ===\nLike all Search/Destroy agents, Alpha is armed with highly advanced technology. His usual equipment includes a variable-cartridge blaster, electrified brass knuckles, a short-range teleporter, a \"time drogue\" that can briefly \"rewind\" the last few minutes of time in the immediate area, and \"time bombs\" which can transport somebody minutes or hours forwards or backwards in time (by which time the planet has moved in its orbit, causing the victim to reappear in empty space).\nJohnny Alpha has white, incandescent eyes and multiple mutant abilities. Most frequently, high-level alpha radiation emitted from his eyes allows Johnny to see through walls and other solid objects, or to read people's minds. He has also used his piercing stare to inflict severe headaches on his opponents. He can also \"suggest\" illusions into their perceptions. Alpha has used this to save his life several times. In the stories \"Judgement Day\" and \"Rage\", Alpha makes Sabbat the Necromagus and Max Bubba respectively believe that people are behind them, distracting each long enough for Alpha to strike.\n\n\n== Supporting cast ==\nWulf Sternhammer\nJohnny's original partner. He is not a mutant but a normal human from Scandinavia. He became a strontium dog out of a sense of camaraderie with Johnny, and, despite the indignities, he viewed it as good work as it kept the galaxy \"safe for decent people\". A blunt and straightforward brawler, Wulf is far less prone to doubt and introspection and tries to bring his friend back in line when he has doubts. Since Starlord #5, Wulf wears the fur pelt of a Gronk that he'd befriended; the alien's custom was for people dear to them to wear their skin, so part of them would live on. Wulf acts a lot like a stereotypical Viking. Eventually, it was retconned that he was a Viking, accidentally brought into the 22nd century when Johnny was pursuing a criminal gang through time.\nThe Gronk\nEarly strips include the brother of the Gronk that Wulf had met earlier. It is a timid, metal-eating alien from the planet Blas, in the Gallego system (a tribute to the fantasy artist Blas Gallego). The Gronk provided medical back-up and constantly worried about its \"poor heartses\", and in \"Outlaw\" showed it could survive multiple heart attacks. A gag showed that \"the Gronk\" was the name for most of its species, causing problems when mail arrives for \"the Gronk\". In the Strontium Dogs spinoff, the Gronk transformed into a gun-toting highly aggressive soldier.\nKing Clarkie the Second\nA thinly veiled parody of Prince Charles. He is the monarch for much of the strip, being deposed late in the series for his pro-mutant views. While presented as a buffoon in several strips, he was also essentially harmless and well-meaning.\nMiddenface McNulty\nA mutant Scottish ally who was raised in a ghetto/concentration camp, 'Shytehill'. McNulty's  head is covered with lumps. He later has a solo spin-off series.\nDurham Red\nA female mutant agent whose mutation resembles vampirism and who is thus feared and despised by other mutants. She also has a solo spin-off series.\nRuth\nJohnny's \"norm\" sister. Her husband is Nigel; they have a daughter, Marci. Ruth and her family remain friendly to Johnny, even helping him blackmail Nelson during the Mutant Army uprising of 2167. During an early comic book adventure, Marci is abducted and almost killed by a criminal who seeks revenge on Johnny. After this, Ruth forbids him from coming near her family again, only making contact with him afterward when she deems it absolutely necessary.\nNelson Culliver\nHalf-brother to Johnny, a result of an extramarital affair by Nelson Kreelman. After the war, Culliver becomes head of the Anti-Mutant Squad at Scotland Yard. In \"Traitor to His Kind\", Culliver tries to have Alpha murdered, but he is exposed and dismissed. Alpha decides to assassinate him, but he changes his mind after meeting Culliver's children.\nFeral\nA young, savage mutant introduced in \"The Final Solution\". He initially despises the strontium dogs, who he saw as abandoning the mutants on Earth, but he is inspired by the actions of Johnny Alpha. Feral witnesses Alpha's sacrifice in \"The Final Solution\", and in the original strips of the 1990s, he becomes first a rebel outlaw in the colony worlds and then a renowned SD Agent. In \"The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha\", this was ignored and he becomes a strontium dog soon after \"The Final Solution\", but due to his abrasive personality, he soon left and becomes an outlaw who tries to resurrect Alpha, only to give up. In this second timeline, he is executed for murder on an alien world.\nStix Clan\nIn both the original series and the revival, Alpha frequently encounters or works alongside members of a mutant family. All members, male and female, are identical in appearance, personality and dress sense. They all hail from one town called Stixville on the colony of Freedonia and are highly hostile to outsiders. They often appear as antagonists to Alpha but at times they have work alongside him. However, they usually betray him at some point, showing only the slightest loyalty to other Stix. There is said to be only one good Stix, Father Phineas who is a Catholic priest, a genuinely good and kind person and thus unmentionable around the rest of the Clan.\nNegus\nIntroduced in the revival, he is the First Lord of the Military, a stern-faced and middle-aged politician who both hires Johnny and acts as his Upminster contact. Negus pushes for increased mutant rights, having a mutant daughter that he kept at home (something Johnny remarked as being a brave act for a man in Negus' position), though he still wanted to keep mutant and norm bloodlines separate.\nPrecious Matson\nA reporter from the mutant colony of Freedonia who appears in Flashbacks to the pre-Wulf days of Johnny's life. Competent and dogged, she befriends Johnny and helps him against the terrorist leader Blood Moon. In \"Life and Death\", she investigates the true events of Johnny's death. With McNulty's aid, she is able to resurrect him.\nKenton Sternhammer\nSon of Wulf, he is introduced in \"The Son\" (2018). He becomes a member of the Search/Destroy Agency.\n\n\n== Major stories ==\n\n\n=== Original run ===\n\"Portrait of a Mutant\", a flashback story in 1981, filled in the background of the series and Johnny's role in the Mutant Army; it introduced Kreelman and the Kreelers, his quasi-official anti-mutant police. Kreelman drafted laws stating mutants were not allowed to work or own businesses, leading to them being forced from their homes into slums and eventually into being forced into labour camps; the only option for many mutants was to join the nationwide guerilla Mutant Army. An attack was launched on Upminster in 2167 as part of a general uprising, but the Army's leaders were forced to surrender in the face of mass mutant executions. Kreelman used this as an opportunity to push forward the extermination of all mutants; Johnny Alpha and the other leaders escaped (thanks to Johnny's sister and mother) and led the Mutant Army in a second major uprising to prevent genocide. The Prime Minister and King agreed to draft into law a better deal for mutants, and - after hearing Alpha was Kreelman's son from Ruth - blackmailed Kreelman into resigning. The mutant leaders were pardoned on condition they go into exile in space, leading to the creation of the Search/Destroy agency; the Kreelers were disbanded and replaced with a new police force. This changeover was depicted by a panel showing Kreelers, which was then repeated but with a different uniform, showing that the same people and attitudes remained. In the present day, bookending \"Portrait\", Johnny tracked his father down and activated a time device, causing his father to relive his final moments: begging for his life, forever.\nIn the story \"Outlaw\", Kreelman was later freed, and, in disguise, had himself appointed head of the Search/Destroy agency. He used his position to frame Johnny and other Mutant Army veterans for murder. Johnny was soon made aware of the truth and had no qualms about dragging his own father before the deceived mutants who gunned him down on the spot.\nIn the 1986 story \"Max Bubba\", a lengthy story explaining Wulf's origins, Wulf was killed off at the hands of Max Bubba and his gang. This led to the epic \"Rage\", in which Johnny remorselessly hunted down his partner's killers. After that Johnny either worked solo, or with Durham Red or Scottish mutant Middenface McNulty.\nJohnny was killed off in 1990, sacrificing himself to save mutants from extermination at the hands of Kreelman's illegitimate son, Lord Sagan. Artist Carlos Ezquerra disagreed with the decision to kill him and refused to draw it, so Johnny's final adventures were illustrated by Simon Harrison and Colin MacNeil. John Wagner later admitted in Judge Dredd Megazine's Thrill Power Overload feature on the history of the comic that \"killing off Johnny Alpha was a mistake [that] I'm doing my best to rectify.\" He later described it as \"one of the big regrets of my career, probably the biggest.\"\n\n\n=== Post-death and Strontium Dogs ===\nThe medium of time travel allowed him to make further appearances. In the 1991 Judge Dredd Annual John Wagner wrote and Colin MacNeil drew \"Top Dogs\", in which Johnny and Wulf travel back in time to Mega-City One in pursuit of a criminal, whilst encountering and only narrowly escaping Judge Dredd. Johnny and Dredd renewed acquaintances in 1992 in the Judge Dredd story \"Judgement Day\", written by Garth Ennis and drawn mainly by Ezquerra.\nThe supporting cast would gain their own spin-off strip Strontium Dogs in the 1990s, written by Garth Ennis and Peter Hogan. It was criticised by Ennis in the book Thrill Power Overload as being anticlimactic and that the lead, Feral, \"was nowhere near as interesting as Johnny\". The series was scrapped when David Bishop became 2000 AD's editor. The first story, \"Monster\" starring Feral, revealed the Search Destroy Agency no longer existed and mutants had been driven off Earth by a hastily assembled UK junta government; colony worlds were also shown to be under military occupation and severely ill-treating mutants, with the alleged mutant resistance merely using their organisation to extort \"liberation\" taxes from mutants (an allegory for The Troubles in Northern Ireland, Ennis' home).\nEnnis would bring back the Gronk in \"Return of the Gronk\", turning him into an aggressive berserker: learning that Johnny Alpha was dead caused a heart attack which awakened his aggressive side of this one. The Gronk and Feral were teamed up, and went out for revenge against the necromancers who had killed Alpha in \"The Darkest Star\". In the process, Feral found out he was the son of the lead necromancer and both he and the Gronk discovered that the necromancers drew their power from torturing the people they had killed – including Johnny Alpha. To destroy the enemy, the Gronk killed the captives – including, at his friend's request, Alpha himself, who couldn't live on in such excruciating pain.\nFrom 2000 AD # 897, Peter Hogan became the regular writer on the strip and in prog 898 he resurrected the Search Destroy Agency: an agent named Bullmoose revealed that the Galactic Crime Commission had cut ties with Earth (who had pressed for the Agency to be closed and mutants purged), moved to Ganymede, and recreated the agency as they needed mutants to \"clean their dirty laundry for them\".\nDurham Red was given her own solo series, written by Alan Grant, Peter Hogan and later Dan Abnett. This series continued after Strontium Dogs was cancelled.\n\n\n=== Revival ===\nIn the Prog 2000 holiday special, published at the end of 1999, Johnny Alpha was revived by his original creators, Wagner and Ezquerra. The new stories were set before Johnny's death.\nThe first story, \"The Kreeler Conspiracy\", was based on a treatment Wagner had written for an aborted Strontium Dog TV pilot, and featured Johnny working solo, but Wulf returned in subsequent stories. Wagner introduced the concept that all previous stories were 'folklore' and the current series was the truth, giving him free rein to alter a number of details (such as giving Johnny an AI computer assistant and Kreelman having been President of a unified Earth government). This concept was dropped after \"Conspiracy\", with the later stories directly harkening back to the original run.\nA subsequent story in 2004, \"Traitor To His Kind\" (progs 1406–1415), introduced Johnny's half-brother, head of a brutal police unit that dealt with mutant crimes. Hired by pro-mutant First Lord Negus, Johnny was sent to get a kidnapped King Clarkie back from mutant guerillas; loath though he was to do so, he knew elements within the government were trying to use this as an excuse to viciously crack down on mutants. Johnny and Wulf rescue the King, as well as uncovering a conspiracy in the Home Office to allow the kidnapping and subsequently fake the King's murder so as to provide a reason for mutant brutalisation. While this led to an improvement in the lives of mutants, all of it was behind the scenes and Johnny Alpha was branded a traitor by mutants for working against his kind.\nThe 2009 story Blood Moon retconned in a fanatical mutant rebel leader, William Blood Moon, who was responsible for civilian massacres and suicide bombings. Johnny had been seconded to him during the war, and swore vengeance for Moon having his friend Mardi killed as a suicide bomber; years later, before meeting Wulf, he and other former rebel leaders would hunt down Blood Moon to kill him for his continuing terrorist atrocities. Johnny would use a time bomb to take Moon back to the site of Mardi's bombing and executed him there.\n\n\n=== \"The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha\" ===\nIn prog 1689, June 2010, Wagner and Ezquerra began a strip called \"The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha\", which took place following \"The Final Solution\". The strip featured reporter Precious Matson trying to discover the true circumstances behind Johnny's death: the story explicitly stated itself to be a retcon and the \"true\" story of what happened, and diverged from \"The Final Solution\" when Precious revealed to Middenface McNulty that Johnny's body had been brought back by Feral (the original strip showed it destroyed and the remains left behind). Mutants remain on Earth, the S/D Agency still exists and has a new Doghouse satellite, and the UK government is said to be \"apologists and mutie-lovers\", ignoring Strontium Dogs.\nMiddenface and Precious went searching for the truth behind Johnny's death and the whereabouts of his body. In the process, they found out that Feral had taken the body on a quest for the Stone Wizards, immensely powerful entities that could bring Johnny back to life – but, as the cost would be his own life, he backed out and buried him instead. (Feral would end up executed during the story for unrelated crimes.) Precious and Middenface located the body and took it to the Stone Wizards, where McNulty offered to die so Johnny would live – the story ended with Johnny returning to life.\nThe story continued in three further installments from 2011 to 2014. Alpha discovered a conspiracy to secretly sterilise all mutants in New Britain. This revelation led to a new civil war, with Alpha leading the mutant faction.\nAfter the conclusion of \"The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha\", the series returned to its bounty-hunter premise. In \"The Son\" (2018) a new character, Wulf Sternhammer's son Kenton, joined Johnny Alpha as a rookie Search/Destroy agent. This was the last Strontium Dog story to be illustrated by Carlos Ezquerra, who died later that year, and the last in the series to be written by John Wagner (as of May 2025). Other writers and artists have produced one-episode stories since, but no multi-part stories.\n\n\n== Hiatus ==\nSince the death of artist Carlos Ezquerra in October 2018, the editor of 2000AD, Matt Smith, has said he is yet to decide whether the series should continue without Ezquerra. However he has said that spin off series set around popular supporting characters are in development. A story starring the Stix Clan was later published in the May 2019 Villains Takeover Special. In 2020 a one-episode story about Johnny Alpha as a child appeared in prog 2183, by Michael Carroll and Nick Brokenshire.\n\n\n== Crossover stories ==\nJohnny Alpha has also appeared in three Judge Dredd stories, in which he travelled back in time to Dredd's era. The first was \"Top Dogs\", written by John Wagner, which appeared in the Judge Dredd Annual 1991 (published in 1990). The second was \"Judgement Day\", a 20-episode story written by Garth Ennis, which appeared in both 2000 AD and in the Judge Dredd Megazine in 1992. The third was \"By Private Contract\" in issue 2000 of 2000 AD in September 2016, also written by Wagner.\nHe also stars with Judge Dredd in the Big Finish audio book Pre-Emptive Revenge, in their attempt to stop a nuclear dirty bomb from launching while trying to reach safety after a successful co-operative mission.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nIn 1987, Titan Books produced the first collected volume of Strontium Dog stories and others have appeared piecemeal over the years.

He is best known for his starring roles as detectives in the crime drama television series Bergerac (1981–1991) in the title role, and Midsomer Murders (1997–2011) as Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby. He has also narrated several television series.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNettles was born in St Austell in 1943. His birth mother was an Irish nurse who came to work in Great Britain during the Second World War. He was adopted at birth by carpenter Eric Nettles and his wife Elsie. \nAs a youth, he attended St Austell Grammar School. In 1962 he went to study history and philosophy at the University of Southampton, where he developed an interest in acting, and after graduation he joined the Royal Court Theatre.\n\n\n== Acting career ==\n\nNettles played Laertes to Tom Courtenay's Hamlet in 1969 at the University Theatre for 69 Theatre Company in Manchester. From 1969 to 1970, he was in repertory at the Northcott Theatre in Exeter, and in the latter year had his first screen role in the film One More Time. The following year he played Dr. Ian Mackenzie in the period drama A Family at War, a role he continued until 1972. Following that he had small parts in many TV programmes including The Liver Birds, Dickens of London, Robin of Sherwood and an episode of Enemy at the Door called \"Officers of the Law\", first broadcast in March 1978. The latter was set in Guernsey during the German occupation of the Channel Islands in the Second World War and Nettles played a police detective ordered to work for the Germans, who is anguished over the conflict between his duty and collaborating with the enemy.\nIn 1981, Nettles became a household name in the UK when Robert Banks Stewart cast him as States of Jersey Police officer Jim Bergerac in the crime drama Bergerac. The series ran for 87 episodes on BBC1 until 1991. Following the end of Bergerac, Nettles did five seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing in The Winter's Tale, The Merry Wives of Windsor, Julius Caesar, Richard III and The Devil Is an Ass. In 1992 he appeared in an episode of Boon, and in 1993 reprised the role of Jim Bergerac in a guest appearance in the spoof police comedy The Detectives.\nIn 1995, Nettles was approached by Brian True-May to play Tom Barnaby in a new murder mystery series he was to produce called Midsomer Murders. This was to be the second major role of his television career, again playing a police detective. Midsomer Murders was an immediate hit, achieving 13.5 million viewers on its launch in 1997 and was sold to more than 200 countries worldwide. In 2001 Nettles guest-starred in an episode of Heartbeat playing fraudster Giles Sutton. In 2003 he played Barnaby in the Boxing Day episode of French & Saunders. In 2007 he appeared in the BBC Radio 4 comedy series Will Smith Presents the Tao of Bergerac, alongside comedian Will Smith, which was about an obsessive fan of the series.\nIn February 2009, it was announced that Nettles had decided to leave Midsomer Murders after two further series were made. His final appearance on-screen was on 2 February 2011, by which time he had appeared in 81 episodes. About his departure, he commented, \"It’s always wise to leave people wanting more, rather than be booed off the stage because you bored them.\"\nIn 2016 and 2017, Nettles had a recurring role as Ray Penvenen in the second and third series of the historical drama Poldark.\nHe later retired from acting, although would still provide voice work on television. He turned down the offer for a cameo appearance in the 2025 reboot of Bergerac'.\n\n\n== Other television work ==\nIn 1982, Nettles was Raoul (the 4th man) in The Agatha Christie Hour story The Fourth Man.\nIn the 1990s, Nettles narrated the BBC documentary X Cars following Greater Manchester Police's stolen car squad during the height of the UK wide joyriding crime wave.\nNettles narrated Wild Discovery in 1995 and the BBC documentary series Airport from 1996 to 2005.\nIn early 2010, Nettles wrote, presented and produced a three-part documentary, Channel Islands at War, to mark the 70th anniversary of the German invasion and subsequent occupation of the Channel Islands. He received threatening letters from some residents of Jersey, accusing him of implying that islanders were collaborators. He defended the documentary saying: \"There is no possible way you could have avoided collaboration with the occupying power who had power over the civilian population. If you had not toed the line you would have been shot.\" This view was supported by local historians and members of the Channel Islands Occupation Society.\nIn 2020, Nettles took over as the narrator on the Channel 4 television show Devon and Cornwall, a sister show to the network's The Yorkshire Dales and the Lakes programme.\n\n\n== Books ==\nDuring the filming of Bergerac, filmed on the island of Jersey, he wrote Bergerac's Jersey (BBC Books, 1988; ISBN 0-563-20703-5), a travel guide to filming locations in the series. He followed up with John Nettles' Jersey: A Personal View of the People and Places (BBC Books, 1992; ISBN 0-563-36318-5) about the island's landscape, personalities and history.\nIn 1991, he wrote the semi-autobiographical Nudity in a Public Place: Confessions of a Mini Celebrity (Robson Books; ISBN 0-7451-1961-1) about becoming a \"reluctant heartthrob\" to female viewers of Bergerac. This was re-released as a Kindle version on Amazon in 2014 following the reruns of Bergerac on BBC2 as part of their afternoon nostalgia collection.\nIn 2012, Nettles wrote Jewels and Jackboots (Hardback ISBN 978-1-905095-38-4) about the German occupation of the Channel Islands. It sold out in a matter of weeks and was republished in 2013 as a paperback and on Kindle.\nIn 2019, John Nettles published an edition of the diaries of Reverend Douglas Ord during the German occupation of Guernsey during World War 2 (Hardback ISBN 978-1-9993415-0-3). Nettles edited the diaries as well as writing an introduction.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNettles married his first wife, Joyce Middleton, in 1967. Their daughter, Emma Martins, was born in 1970, and moved to Jersey with her father for Bergerac. She joined the States of Jersey Police, working with officers who met her father during the show's filming. After the Nettles' divorce in 1979, Joyce became a casting director for Midsomer Murders.\nNettles married his second wife, Cathryn Sealey, in July 1995 in Evesham, Worcestershire.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nNettles was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours. \n\n\n== Awards ==\n1996 - University of Wolverhampton. Honorary Master of Art was awarded to John Nettles.\nIn 2006, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Southampton, from which he had graduated.\nOn 21 September 2012, Nettles was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Plymouth. He also agreed to be a patron of Devon charity The Mare and Foal Sanctuary in July 2014.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \n\nJohn Nettles at IMDb \nJohn Nettles at Rotten Tomatoes \nJohn Nettles at the British Film Institute\nJohn Nettles at the TCM Movie Database", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:11:40Z"}

Anytime you find an item of interest, a question mark (?) will appear to indicate that it can be checked, which will later change to an exclamation point afterwards.\nPlayers can use items such as stones, money and a shovel, depending on their needs. Stones can be used as thrown items or landmarks, the shovel to dig up specific spots such as sand and money as currency to be used in certain places, such as peace offerings. The heartbeat system is used to alert players if a monster is nearby, making the girl move slower and force her actions to be limited. The only way to hide from the monsters is to evade them after observing their patterns or hide in areas like bushes and wait for them to go away with the heartbeat serving as a de facto radar to locate where the monsters are while relying on sounds to make a judgement call to see if its safe to come out of hiding.\nIn case players need to refresh themselves on what happened the previous nights, they can catch up again by reading the girl's diary.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA young girl takes her dog named Poro out for a walk. When an accident nearly kills her, she finds her dog missing. Her elder sister agrees to go out and look for Poro. After a few hours of waiting, the girl noticed that her sister is out late.\nGoing out of her house, she explores the town and notices that it changed. The girl later evades monsters prowling the empty streets while finding clues as to what happened to Poro, her elder sister and who or what was responsible for their disappearance.\n\n\n== Release ==\nPhysical copies of the game in North America and Europe came bundled with Hotaru no Nikki. Both games are on the same Vita cartridge, while the Windows collector's edition was released with an additional code to download the game.\nSimilar to other Nippon Ichi Software games, Sega will be handling publishing duties for the physical copies for Nintendo Switch in Asia outside Japan. The Asia release comes with Traditional Chinese and Japanese language installed and was released on October 25, 2018.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nToshi Nakamura of Kotaku calls it a very emotional game, serving as a \"coming of age story of a little girl learning of mortality\".\nAccording to NIS, Yomawari sold around 48,000 copies of the game in Japan.\n\n\n== Sequel ==\nOn April 25, 2017, Nippon Ichi Software announced a sequel titled Yomawari: Midnight Shadows, which was released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in Japan in August 2017.

{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "534622", "title": "Alexander Skarsgård", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Skarsgård", "content_length": 12020, "text": "Alexander Johan Hjalmar Skarsgård (Swedish: [alɛkˈsǎnːdɛr ˈskɑ̌ːʂɡoːɖ] ; born 25 August 1976) is a Swedish actor. A son of actor Stellan Skarsgård, he began acting at the age of seven but quit at thirteen. After serving in the Swedish Navy, Skarsgård returned to acting and gained his first role in the American comedy film Zoolander (2001). He played Brad Colbert in the miniseries Generation Kill (2008) and had his international breakthrough portraying vampire Eric Northman in the television series True Blood (2008–2014).\nAfter appearing in films such as Melancholia (2011), Battleship (2012) and The Legend of Tarzan (2016), Skarsgård starred in the drama series Big Little Lies (2017–2019) as an abusive husband, which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award. He went on to appear in the films Long Shot (2019), Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), Passing (2021), The Northman (2022), which he also produced, Infinity Pool (2023), and Pillion (2025). He also played Randall Flagg in the miniseries The Stand (2020–2021) and tech mogul Lukas Matsson in the drama series Succession (2021–2023), for which he was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. He currently stars in the science-fiction comedy series Murderbot (2025–present).\n\n\n== Early life, family and education ==\nSkarsgård was born on 25 August 1976 in Stockholm, Sweden. He is the eldest son of actor Stellan Skarsgård and physician My Skarsgård. His parents are divorced. He has five younger siblings: Gustaf, Sam, Bill, Eija and Valter, and two half-brothers, Ossian and Kolbjörn, from his father's second wife, Megan Everett. Gustaf, Bill, Valter, and Kolbjörn are also actors.\nA friend of his father's, a director, gave Skarsgård his first film role when he was seven years old, playing Kalle Nubb in Åke and His World (Åke och hans värld). In 1989, his lead role in the Swedish television production Hunden som log (The Dog That Smiled) earned him praise and brought him to prominence in Sweden at age 13. Uncomfortable with the fame, he quit acting at that same age.\nAt 19, Skarsgård applied for his national service. He served for 18 months in the Swedish Navy's SäkJakt (\"protect and hunt\") unit that dealt with anti-sabotage and anti-terrorism in the Stockholm archipelago. After completing his service in 1996, he left Sweden and attended Leeds Metropolitan University in England for six months. He enrolled to study English but admits he did not study much and \"had a blast\" instead. While there, he considered pursuing an architecture career, but chose acting instead. In 1997, he enrolled in a theatre course at Marymount Manhattan College and moved to New York City. He returned to Stockholm after six months, but his time studying theatre confirmed to him that he wanted to act.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2000s: Career beginnings and television breakthrough ===\n\nOn his return to Sweden, Skarsgård began landing roles in film, television and theatrical productions. While vacationing in the United States, he auditioned for and obtained the part of a mindless model in the 2001 film Zoolander, his first role in an American film. In 2003, his performance in Hundtricket-the Movie (The Dog Trick) earned him an Guldbagge Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He was named the Sexiest Man in Sweden five times.\nHe moved to Los Angeles in 2004 but continued to work in Sweden. His break came when he was cast as US Marine Brad Colbert in the HBO miniseries Generation Kill. An adaptation of journalist Evan Wright's book of the same name, Generation Kill follows the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion of the United States Marine Corps during the early part of the Iraq War. Director Susanna White wanted to cast him, but executive producer David Simon was not convinced he could do a convincing American accent. After four auditions in three cities, Skarsgård learned the role was his just 36 hours before he had to board a plane for Namibia where the project was filming. The cast and crew spent seven months in the desert there, shooting six days a week. Skarsgård worked with a dialect coach to master the American accent.\nJust before leaving to shoot Generation Kill, Skarsgård heard about the development of True Blood, an HBO series based on The Southern Vampire Mysteries novels by Charlaine Harris, which chronicle the coexistence of humans and vampires in a town in Louisiana. Though initially reluctant about playing a vampire, he sent an audition tape for the role of Bill Compton on learning that screenwriter Alan Ball was behind the project. Skarsgård had been a fan of Ball's series Six Feet Under and film American Beauty. The role went to Stephen Moyer, but Skarsgård was cast as Eric Northman, a 1,000-year-old Nordic vampire. Northman first appeared in the first season's fourth episode, and the role brought Skarsgård to prominence. To inform his portrayal, he studied the work of actors Max Schreck and Bela Lugosi and the film Nosferatu (1922). He said that playing Northman appealed to his preference for characters who were not simply diabolical or righteous. True Blood ran on HBO from 2008 to 2014, receiving mixed reviews.\nIn 2009, Skarsgård appeared in the music video for pop singer Lady Gaga's \"Paparazzi\". He was the voice of Stefan in the 2009 animated film Metropia, directed by Tarik Saleh.\n\n\n=== 2010s: Film and television success ===\n\nIn 2010, Skarsgård portrayed Terje, a gay Norwegian trekking to the North Pole, in the British mockumentary Beyond the Pole. Suit-maker Hickey Freeman chose Skarsgård to model a new look it debuted in 2010. Annie Leibovitz photographed the ad campaign, which appeared in The Wall Street Journal Magazine, GQ and Details. Skarsgård appeared on the cover of the September 2010 issue of Rolling Stone with his True Blood co-stars Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer.\nIn 2011, Skarsgård starred in Melancholia, a film directed by Lars von Trier. He portrayed a newlywed alongside Kirsten Dunst as his wife in the film, which premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and also co-stars his father. That same year, he appeared in Straw Dogs, a remake of the 1971 film of the same name, as Charlie Venner. The remake's director, Rod Lurie, transferred the small town setting from Cornwall to Mississippi and described Venner as \"an ex-football star gone to seed\". The film co-starred James Marsden and Kate Bosworth, and was released 16 September 2011.\nIn 2012, Skarsgård appeared alongside Taylor Kitsch and Rihanna in Peter Berg's Battleship, an adaptation of the Hasbro game of the same name. Negatively reviewed by critics, the film had a dismal performance at the box office. He also appeared alongside Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan in Scott McGehee and David Siegel's film What Maisie Knew, an adaptation of the Henry James novel of the same name. He was also part of the ensemble cast in Henry Alex Rubin's thriller Disconnect, playing opposite Paula Patton. Skarsgård starred alongside Brit Marling and Elliot Page in Zal Batmanglij's 2013 film The East. He appeared in the film The Diary of a Teenage Girl as a man who begins an affair with his girlfriend's underage daughter. It was released in August 2015. In addition to being intentional about finding nuances in the character's predatory quality, Skarsgård admitted his excitement about playing the role \"without justifying or condoning\" his behavior. He starred in the 2016 film The Legend of Tarzan, portraying the title character, opposite Margot Robbie as Jane. Skarsgård worked out for 7 months to prepare for the part. The film did not generate success at the box office. It received mixed reviews, with Skarsgård's performance garnering praise. He next portrayed a deviant policeman in the black comedy film War on Everyone, which was released that same year.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, Skarsgård starred in the drama series Big Little Lies as Perry Wright, an abusive husband to Nicole Kidman's character, Celeste. He described his character as violent due to internal conflicts involving his insecurities about needing his wife. The series earned universal acclaim. Reviewing the first-season finale, The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg found Skarsgård's performance \"utterly chilling\". Skarsgård won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie in 2017 for the role. He starred in the science fiction film Mute as a silent bartender in a futuristic society, which was released in February 2018. Later that year, he starred as a secretive man in The Little Drummer Girl, a miniseries that chronicles political violence in Europe in 1979. It received positive reviews. In 2019, he portrayed a sensitive German architect in The Aftermath, a film set in 1946 post-war Hamburg. He appeared in the romantic-comedy Long Shot as the prime minister of Canada. Critics were fond of the film, with The Guardian's Kristy Puchko commending Skarsgård in the minor role and how he \"makes a meal out of it\". Released in May 2019, it had an unsuccessful commercial performance.\n\n\n=== 2020s: Continued success ===\n\nSkarsgård starred in The Stand, a CBS All Access miniseries based on the 1978 novel of the same name by Stephen King, portraying Randall Flagg, a charming demon. It ran from December 2020 to February 2021. He next starred in the 2021 monster film Godzilla vs. Kong, which earned positive reviews and commercial success. Skarsgård recurred during the third season of the comedy-drama series Succession as tech mogul Lukas Matsson, for which he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. He portrayed Amleth in the epic film The Northman. Released in April 2022, the film garnered favorable reviews, with Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair deeming Skarsgård \"a fine vessel for the film's opulent menace\". In 2023, Skarsgård starred in the thriller Infinity Pool, and returned as Lukas Matsson for the fourth and final season of Succession. For his role as Matsson, Skarsgård was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2023.\nIn 2025, he played the title role in the science-fiction comedy series Murderbot on Apple TV+, and stars as a sexually dominant gay biker in the British film Pillion.\nSkarsgård hosted the 1,000th episode of Saturday Night Live on 31 January 2026 with rapper Cardi B as the musical guest.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSkarsgård is an atheist. A football fan, Skarsgård supports Hammarby Fotboll, a club based in Stockholm, his birth city. In October 2010, he donated several autographed items to \"Bajen Aid\", the club's fundraising auction. In July 2011, he received an honorary degree from Leeds Metropolitan University, which he had attended. Skarsgård stated in 2018 that he is a feminist.\nSkarsgård was the Ambassador for the American team for a Walking with the Wounded fundraising event for wounded soldiers. He trekked to the South Pole against Team UK (Prince Harry, Ambassador) and Team Canada / Australia (actor Dominic West, Ambassador). A few days into the trek, it was decided that the competition part would be cancelled due to hazardous terrain and weather conditions, so the teams combined forces and continued together, and all three successfully reached the South Pole on 13 December 2013.\nSkarsgård lived in the United States for 20 years; first in New York, then in Los Angeles while he was filming True Blood for seven years until he moved back to New York. In 2023, he relocated to Stockholm, Sweden.\nSkarsgård has a son, born in 2022, with Swedish actress Tuva Novotny. Skarsgård lives in Sweden while Novotny lives in Denmark.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of atheists in film, radio, television and theater\nList of Golden Globe winners\nList of Primetime Emmy Award winners\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAlexander Skarsgård at IMDb\nAlexander Skarsgård at the Swedish Film Database", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:11:41Z"}

{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "900702", "title": "Bebe Buell", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebe_Buell", "content_length": 5595, "text": "Beverle Lorence \"Bebe\" Buell ( BEE-bee BEWL; born July 14, 1953) is an American singer and former model. She was Playboy magazine's November 1974 Playmate of the Month. Buell moved to New York in 1972 after signing a modeling contract with Eileen Ford, and garnered notability after her publicized relationship with musician Todd Rundgren from 1972 until 1978, as well as her liaisons with several rock musicians during that time and over the following four decades. She is the mother of actress Liv Tyler (born 1977), whose biological father is Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. Todd Rundgren is Liv's legal father, as he signed the birth certificate.\nIn 2001 Buell published her autobiography with St. Martin's Press (with Victor Bockris), Rebel Heart: An American Rock and Roll Journey. The book was a New York Times bestseller. The paperback was issued in 2002.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBuell was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, the daughter of Dorothea (Brown) Johnson, who founded the Protocol School of Washington, and Harold Lloyd Buell, a U.S. Navy officer and World War II veteran. As her father was not at home at the time of Buell's birth, her mother waited until he got back before naming her daughter. The nurses in the hospital took to calling her \"Baby Buell,\" which is where her nickname of \"Bebe\" originated. She is of German descent.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Modeling ===\nBuell was discovered by modeling agency executive Eileen Ford after high school graduation at age 17, and relocated to New York City at age 18. She was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for the November 1974 issue; her centerfold was photographed by Richard Fegley. Describing her early years and modeling career, Buell said, \"[I wanted] to be a professional singer [which was why] I came to New York—yes, I was a pretty young girl, so I fell into the modeling thing, and [then] I did Playboy, so then the rock stars came a-hunting, as I like to say.\"\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nIn 1981 Buell recorded a four-song EP on Rhino Records, produced by Rick Derringer and Ric Ocasek, with the Cars serving as her band on two tracks. The rock band the Power Station began in 1984 when her then-boyfriend John Taylor (of Duran Duran fame) pulled some famous friends together to provide backing for another of Buell's musical efforts. She also formed the band the B-Sides in 1980; it disbanded in 1985.\nIn 1985 Buell started another band, The Gargoyles, and released a couple of singles. A few large record companies showed interest, but the Gargoyles disbanded when Liv Tyler's paternity became public in 1991. Buell withdrew from performing for six years in the 1990s. She managed Liv's career as an international model and actress. She also represented actress Charis Michelsen.\nAfter Liv left home in 1997, Buell recorded a solo effort with producer Don Fleming, released in 2000. She also performed around New York with the Bebe Buell Band and later with Boston musicians The Rudds and the Neighborhoods' drummer Johnny Lynch, forming a new band for a few shows that also included her husband, James Wallerstein.\nIn May 2009 Buell released her first recording in ten years, the single \"Air Kisses for the Masses\". She then recorded a 12-song album that can be downloaded on iTunes or Amazon MP3. Buell played a series of live shows in the New York City area to promote the single.\nIn September 2011 Buell released Hard Love, an aggressive rock album influenced by grunge and glam rock. It was produced by Wallerstein and Stephen DeAcutis. The 11-track record features original songs alongside covers of Gang of Four's \"I Love a Man in Uniform\" and \"Baby Baby\" by the English punk rock band the Vibrators.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBuell has dated many musicians, beginning with Paul Cowsill of the Cowsills when she was 15. She has dated Mick Jagger, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Elvis Costello, Todd Rundgren, Jimmy Page, Duran Duran's John Taylor, and Steven Tyler among others, but she rejects the label \"groupie\".\nFrom 1972 to 1978, Bebe Buell had a longterm, on and off, relationship with Todd Rundgren. In 1976, Buell became unexpectedly pregnant from a brief relationship with Steven Tyler. On July 1, 1977, Buell gave birth to future actress/model Liv Tyler, but Buell initially named her child Liv Rundgren and claimed that Todd Rundgren was the biological father to protect the child from Tyler's drug addiction. Rundgren and Buell ended their romantic relationship shortly after Liv's birth. At age 9, Liv found out that she was Steven Tyler's biological daughter.\nIn 1992, Buell married for the first time. She wed sometime-musician and actor Coyote Shivers. They divorced in 1999 after a year-long separation. In 2002, she married musician Jim Wallerstein (aka Jim Walters) of Das Damen.\nFor his film Almost Famous, music journalist and filmmaker Cameron Crowe developed the \"band-aid\" character Penny Lane as a composite of a handful of girls he saw backstage in the late 1960s and early 1970s at concerts calling themselves the \"Flying Garter Girls\". One girl who went by the nickname Penny Lane is real-life Pennie Lane Trumbull, born in Portland, Oregon, in 1954. Though they were not in the Flying Garter Girls group, various other women have been described as Crowe's inspiration, for instance Pamela Des Barres and Buell. Buell partially inspired Crowe; he named a lead singer character Jeff Bebe.\nBuell lived in New York and New Jersey before relocating to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2013.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nBebe Buell at Playboy Plus\nBebe Buell at IMDb", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:11:45Z"}

His father was an officer in the Royal Navy, and the family moved to wherever he was stationed, including Malta and Singapore, but mostly in Portsmouth. He attended Padnell Junior School in Cowplain, followed by Horndean Technology College (then known as Horndean Bilateral School).\nWingett wanted to act from his youth and joined the National Youth Theatre. His film debut came in 1979 when he played Dave, a reckless and rebellious mod, in Quadrophenia. \nIn 1983 he took a minor role as a local press reporter in Channel 4's Brookside before making his first appearance as PC Jim Carver in \"Woodentop\", which became the pilot episode for The Bill. He was one of four actors in \"Woodentop\" who returned in the series' first complete season.

Ashmore received a Leo Award for Legend of Earthsea (2004) and has earned multiple Gemini and Saturn Award nominations.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nShawn Robert Ashmore was born on October 7, 1979, in Richmond, British Columbia, to Linda Davis, a homemaker, and Rick Ashmore, a senior manager in the floor-covering industry. When he was a few weeks old, his family moved to St. Albert, Alberta, where he spent much of his early childhood. Around age ten, Ashmore relocated with his family to Brampton, Ontario, where he later attended Turner Fenton Secondary School.\nAshmore and his identical twin brother, Aaron, began appearing in television commercials while still in elementary school. According to Shawn, the brothers began acting after a talent agent approached their mother and invited the twins to audition for a commercial. Aaron was initially cast but when he fell ill on the day of filming, Shawn replaced him, landing his first acting role. Early in their careers, casting directors sometimes chose between the identical twins by flipping a coin.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early work and breakthrough (1990s–2004) ===\nAt age nine, Ashmore made his screen debut on the CTV series Katts and Dog (1990). The following year, he and his brother appeared in minor roles in the feature film Married to It (1991). Ashmore's first starring role was in the family television film Guitarman (1994), which, at age 14, earned him a Gemini Award nomination for Best Performance in a Children's/Youth Program. In his late teens, Ashmore chose to pursue acting full-time after realizing he was happiest while working on set.\nAshmore's first regular television role was Jake Berenson in Animorphs (1998–1999), a Nickelodeon adaptation of K. A. Applegate's popular children's science fiction books. Reflecting on the series in 2022, Ashmore said the show's enduring popularity \"is so crazy to me\", adding he is \"always amazed\" when fans still recognize him from the show. He then starred as EMT cadet Tyler Connell in the Disney Channel series In a Heartbeat (2000–2001) and portrayed cadet major Brad Rigby in the Disney Channel Original Movie Cadet Kelly (2002). He later described this phase of his career during his late teens and early twenties as \"a real Nickelodeon/Disney moment\".\nAshmore debuted as Bobby Drake / Iceman in X-Men (2000). The film was a commercial success, grossing US$296.3 million worldwide and launching a franchise in which Ashmore reprised his role in sequels. He guest-starred as Eric Summers in two episodes of Smallville (2002, 2004), a series in which his brother later portrayed Jimmy Olsen. Ashmore returned as Iceman in an expanded role in X2 (2003), receiving the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Male Performance in 2004. During the lead-up to the film's release, Ashmore reflected on the growing public attention, saying his family \"were a little freaked out when they started realizing that my face was going to be on buses and at movie theatres\".\nIn December 2004, Ashmore starred as the young wizard Ged in the Syfy miniseries Legend of Earthsea an adaption of Ursula K. Le Guin's novels. The production received mixed reviews; Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote: \"Ashmore makes a likable and modest hero\". His performance earned him the 2005 Leo Award for Best Lead Performance by a Male in a Feature Length Drama.\n\n\n=== Film and television (2005–2015) ===\n\nIn 2005, Ashmore portrayed Canadian athlete Terry Fox in the CTV biographical film Terry (2005), dramatizing Fox's long-distance run Marathon of Hope. Reflecting on the role, Ashmore noted: \"the roughest part is the physicality, learning the skip-hop to make it real, and remembering and knowing the movement\". His performance earned him a Gemini Award nomination for Best Actor. Also in 2005, he played Rob Donovan, a prep school student who is coerced into a stolen-car ring, in the action-comedy Underclassman. He also headlined one of three intersecting stories in the HIV/AIDs drama 3 Needles, anchoring the Canadian segment, which depicts the ripple effects of a hidden HIV diagnosis. He closed the year with the psychological thriller The Quiet, portraying basketball player Connor Kennedy, who befriends a social outcast named Dot.\nIn May 2006, Ashmore reprised his role as Iceman in X-Men: The Last Stand, the third installment of 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series. He also voiced the character in the tie-in video game X-Men: The Official Game, bridging the events between X2 and The Last Stand. In 2008, he starred as Eric in the horror film The Ruins, portraying an American tourist in Mexico who is enticed to visit a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. The following year, Ashmore starred in the CTV telefilm Diverted (2009), playing an air‑traffic manager dealing with flights grounded in Newfoundland during the 2001 September 11 attacks in the United States. He also voiced Iceman again in several episodes of the animated series The Super Hero Squad Show.\nIn 2010, Ashmore portrayed Joe Lynch in Adam Green's dramatic thriller Frozen and co‑starred as George Barnum in the ensemble horror remake Mother's Day. Subsequently, he starred as Fitz, a hard-living air-ambulance doctor in the eight-part miniseries Bloodletting & Miraculous Cures, which was adapted from Vincent Lam's Giller Prize–winning stories. Ashmore also served as an executive producer on the series, which received nine Gemini nominations. That November, Ashmore and his brother Aaron guest-starred in the Fringe episode \"Amber 31422\"; Den of Geek praised their performances, describing both actors as \"rather good\". The episode marked the first project on which the brothers had collaborated in fifteen years. Discussing their decision to work together, Ashmore said: \"It's usually because the stuff that came along is kind of hokey, but I think the quality of Fringe is really high and the episode is done well and our characters are intelligent. We're going to have some fun.\"\n\nIn 2011, Ashmore played Adam, one of five survivors who are besieged by cannibals, in the post-apocalyptic thriller The Day. The film premiered in the Midnight Madness programme at Toronto International Film Festival and was later acquired for U.S. distribution by WWE Studios. He next starred in the bilingual road-movie romance Mariachi Gringo (2012), portraying Edward, an aimless Kansan man who relocates to Guadalajara to become a mariachi singer. The film premiered as the opening-night gala of the 29th Miami International Film Festival. From 2013 to 2015, Ashmore starred as FBI special agent Mike Weston on Fox's crime thriller series The Following. Weston remained a central character throughout the show's three-season run. In 2014, Ashmore reprised his role as Iceman in X-Men: Days of Future Past, appearing alongside both returning cast members from the first three films and the cast of the prequel film X-Men: First Class. He praised the decision to unite the original and prequel casts into one film, calling it \"a very interesting and smart way to continue telling this story\".\n\n\n=== Continued screen work and video game debut (2016–2020) ===\nIn 2016, Ashmore moved into interactive media, starring in Microsoft's and Remedy Entertainment's action-adventure game Quantum Break. Using full-body performance capture and voice acting, he portrayed the time-manipulating protagonist Jack Joyce in both gameplay sequences and the game's live-action companion episodes. Upon its release, Quantum Break became Microsoft Studios' best-selling new Xbox One intellectual property and the platform's most-played new title in its launch week. Game Informer praised Ashmore for giving Jack Joyce \"the scope and complexity to be interesting for such long periods of time\", highlighting his natural banter and effective escalation of tension during action sequences. That same year, Ashmore returned to network television as Assistant District Attorney Sam Spencer in the American legal drama Conviction.\nAshmore subsequently appeared in several genre films. He starred as Deputy Conrad \"Colt\" Salter in the science-fiction horror film Devil's Gate, which premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival, and portrayed troubled brother Officer Darryl Tarasoff in the Canadian mystery Hollow in the Land (2017).

He also continued his interactive media work by providing voice, likeness, and motion capture for the playable character Conrad in the horror game The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan (2019).\nIn 2020, Ashmore had a recurring role as Lamplighter, a former member of the superhero group the Seven, in the second season of the Amazon Prime Video superhero series The Boys. Reflecting on the role, Ashmore noted the contrast with his earlier portrayal of Bobby Drake / Iceman, whom he described as \"the quintessential good guy\", saying his casting as Lamplighter \"wasn't a coincidence\". He said: \"One of the things I liked about The Boys is that they subvert the genre, and I really got to lean into that\". Series creator Eric Kripke said Ashmore initially auditioned for another part, but Kripke \"really wanted to get him into the show\" and considered him \"perfect\" for Lamplighter due to Ashmore's \"X-Men pedigree\" and strong acting. Ashmore enjoyed the irony, stating it was fun to play \"both sides of a superhero\".\n\n\n=== Television main cast and expanded game work (2021–present) ===\nIn 2021, Ashmore appeared in two thriller features. He portrayed Kevin Dadich in the Netflix release Aftermath and starred as Nick Miller, an increasingly controlling husband, in the psychological‑horror film The Free Fall, which premiered on October 7 at Grimmfest. That same year, his recurring role as defence attorney Wesley Evers on ABC's show The Rookie was upgraded to a main-cast position at the start of the third season. He reprised the Evers role in \"Standoff\", a 2022 episode of the spin‑off show The Rookie: Feds.\nIn 2023, Ashmore provided voice acting and motion capture for Sheriff Tim Breaker in Remedy Entertainment's survival-horror game Alan Wake II. In the game's downloadable content, Ashmore portrayed an alternate-reality version of himself filming a time-travel game scene, a sequence one reviewer described as \"a real fourth wall break\" that is filled with references and in-jokes about Ashmore's earlier role in Quantum Break. Remedy's Sam Lake noted this character was written specifically for Ashmore as a nod to his earlier collaboration.\nAshmore continued working in interactive media by voicing Timmy LeBlanc in Sons of the Forest (2023). GamesRadar+ reported Ashmore joined the cast as side character Timmy LeBlanc, noting the game's February 2024 update would expand his character's role in the story. In 2025, Ashmore starred as Randall Harris in the supernatural-horror film It Feeds, which was directed by Chad Archibald.\nAshmore co-starred in Just Breathe, a crime thriller marking director Paul Pompa III's feature debut. The film was in post-production in late 2024, and in June 2025, Shout! Studios acquired its North American distribution rights. It had a digital release that September. Ashmore is also set to star in the psychological thriller The Huntsman, which will be directed by Kyle Kauwika Harris. The film, which is based on Judith Sanders's novel, features Ashmore as a repressed ICU nurse who volunteers to read to a comatose patient who is suspected of serial murders.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn July 27, 2012, Shawn Ashmore married Dana Renee Wasdin in Los Angeles; the couple met on the set of the thriller Frozen, where Wasdin served as an assistant director. They have one son, who was born in 2017.\nAshmore and his twin brother Aaron have matching \"GMA\" tattoos on their wrists.

In October 2021, he participated in a virtual meet‑and‑greet auction run by the non-profit A Cause for Entertainment, proceeds from which went to breast-cancer research and patient support.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Video games ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Shawn Ashmore at Wikimedia Commons\nShawn Ashmore at IMDb", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:11:54Z"}

She is also known for her role as Brigitta von Trapp in the 1965 film The Sound of Music. Her older sister is actress Veronica Cartwright.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\n\nAngela Cartwright was born on September 9, 1952, in Altrincham, Cheshire, England. When she was a year old, her family moved to Los Angeles via Canada. Cartwright made her first film appearance at age three as Paul Newman's character's daughter in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), and appeared with Rock Hudson and Sidney Poitier in Something of Value (1957). Cartwright appeared for seven seasons in the CBS TV series The Danny Thomas Show, opposite comedian Danny Thomas. She remained close to Thomas after the series' cancellation until his death on February 6, 1991.\nCartwright played the role of Brigitta von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965). The film won five Academy Awards and eclipsed Gone with the Wind as the highest-grossing film of all-time.\nCartwright played Penny Robinson in the TV series Lost in Space (1965–68). She made appearances on several TV shows, including My Three Sons, Adam-12 and The Love Boat. Cartwright was also cast in the television movie Scout's Honor (1980) and played the role of Miss D'Angelo in High School U.S.A. (1983).\nCartwright played Theresa Mazzetti in Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979), directed by Lost in Space producer Irwin Allen. She has had cameo appearances in the 1998 Lost in Space film and also as Dr. Smith's mother in the third episode of the second season of the 2018 Netflix reimagined Lost In Space series.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nAfter Lost in Space ended, co-star Bill Mumy wanted to continue private tutoring on the set with Cartwright because he had a crush on her.  Though she was two years older than him they later began dating.\nCartwright married Steve Gullion in 1976. They have two children.\nCartwright has been a photographer for 30 years. Her work is displayed at her studio in Studio City, Los Angeles.\nCartwright is a Catholic and has attended Mass at St. Charles Borromeo with her sister Veronica.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Books and publications ==\nPasticcio quartz is a bi-annual journal written and published by Sarah Fishburn and Angela Cartwright.

{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "862179", "title": "Watchdog timer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer", "content_length": 15888, "text": "A watchdog timer (WDT, or simply a watchdog), sometimes called a computer operating properly timer (COP timer), is an electronic or software timer that is used to detect and recover from computer malfunctions. Watchdog timers are widely used in computers to facilitate automatic correction of temporary hardware faults, and to prevent errant or malevolent software from disrupting system operation.\nDuring normal operation, the computer regularly restarts the watchdog timer to prevent it from elapsing, or timing out. If, due to a hardware fault or program error, the computer fails to restart the watchdog, the timer will elapse and generate a timeout signal. The timeout signal is used to initiate corrective actions. The corrective actions typically include placing the computer and associated hardware in a safe state and invoking a computer reboot.\nMicrocontrollers often include an integrated, on-chip watchdog. In other computers the watchdog may reside in a nearby chip that connects directly to the CPU, or it may be located on an external expansion card in the computer's chassis.\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\nWatchdog timers are commonly found in embedded systems and other computer-controlled equipment where humans cannot easily access the equipment or would be unable to react to faults in a timely manner. In such systems, the computer cannot depend on a human to invoke a reboot if it hangs; it must be self-reliant. For example, remote embedded systems such as space probes are not physically accessible to human operators; these could become permanently disabled if they were unable to autonomously recover from faults. In robots and other automated machines, a fault in the control computer could cause equipment damage or injuries before a human could react, even if the computer is easily accessed. A watchdog timer is usually employed in cases like these.\nWatchdog timers are also used to monitor and limit software execution time on a normally functioning computer. For example, a watchdog timer may be used when running untrusted code in a sandbox, to limit the CPU time available to the code and thus prevent some types of denial-of-service attacks. In real-time operating systems, a watchdog timer may be used to monitor a time-critical task to ensure it completes within its maximum allotted time and, if it fails to do so, to terminate the task safely and report the failure.\n\n\n== Architecture and operation ==\n\n\n=== Restarting ===\nThe act of restarting a watchdog timer is commonly referred to as kicking the watchdog. In electronic watchdogs, kicking is typically done by writing to a watchdog control port or by setting a particular bit in a register. Alternatively, some tightly coupled watchdog timers are kicked by executing a special machine language instruction. An example of this is the CLRWDT (clear watchdog timer) instruction found in the instruction set of some PIC microcontrollers.\n\nIn computers that are running operating systems, electronic watchdog restarts are usually invoked through a device driver. For example, in the Linux operating system, a user space program will kick the watchdog by interacting with the watchdog device driver, typically by writing a zero character to /dev/watchdog or by calling a KEEPALIVE ioctl. The device driver, which serves to abstract the watchdog hardware from user space programs, may also be used to configure the time-out period and start and stop the timer.Some watchdog timers will only allow kicks during a specific time window. The window timing is usually relative to the previous kick or, if the watchdog has not yet been kicked, to the moment the watchdog was enabled. The window begins after a delay following the previous kick, and ends after a further delay. If the computer attempts to kick the watchdog before or after the window, the watchdog will not be restarted, and in some implementations this will be treated as a fault and trigger corrective action.\n\n\n=== Enabling ===\nA watchdog timer is said to be enabled when operating and disabled when idle. Upon power-up, a watchdog may be unconditionally enabled or it may be initially disabled and require an external signal to enable it. In the latter case, the enabling signal may be automatically generated by hardware or it may be generated under software control.\n\nWhen automatically generated, the enabling signal is typically derived from the computer reset signal. In some systems the reset signal is directly used to enable the watchdog. In others, the reset signal is delayed so that the watchdog will become enabled at some later time following the reset. This delay allows time for the computer to boot before the watchdog is enabled. Without this delay, the watchdog would timeout and invoke a subsequent reset before the computer can run its application software — the software which kicks the watchdog — and the system would become stuck in an endless cycle of incomplete reboots.\n\n\n=== Single-stage watchdog ===\nWatchdog timers come in many configurations, and many allow their configurations to be altered. For example, the watchdog and CPU may share a common clock signal as shown in the block diagram below, or they may have independent clock signals or in some cases the watchdog may have no clock signal at all. A basic watchdog timer has a single timer which, upon timeout, typically will reset the CPU:\n\n\n=== Multistage watchdog ===\nTwo or more timers are sometimes cascaded to form a multistage watchdog timer, where each timer is referred to as a timer stage, or simply a stage. For example, the block diagram below shows a three-stage watchdog. Depending on the design, this may be implemented with multiple timers, or by emulating multiple timers with a single timer and additional logic.\nIn a multistage watchdog, only the first stage is kicked by the processor. Upon first stage timeout, a corrective action is initiated and the next stage in the cascade is started. As each subsequent stage times out, it triggers a corrective action and starts the next stage. Upon final stage timeout, a corrective action is initiated, but no other stage is started because the end of the cascade has been reached. Typically, single-stage watchdog timers are used to simply restart the computer, whereas multistage watchdog timers will sequentially trigger a series of corrective actions, with the final stage triggering a computer restart.\n\n\n=== Time intervals ===\nWatchdog timers may have either fixed or programmable time intervals. Some watchdog timers allow the time interval to be programmed by selecting from among a few selectable, discrete values. In others, the interval can be programmed to arbitrary values. Typically, watchdog time intervals range from ten milliseconds to a minute or more. In a multistage watchdog, each timer may have its own, unique time interval.\n\n\n== Corrective actions ==\nA watchdog timer may initiate any of several types of corrective action, including maskable interrupt, non-maskable interrupt, hardware reset, fail-safe state activation, power cycling, or combinations of these. Depending on its architecture, the type of corrective action or actions that a watchdog can trigger may be fixed or programmable. Some computers (e.g., PC compatibles) require a pulsed signal to invoke a hardware reset. In such cases, the watchdog typically triggers a hardware reset by activating an internal or external pulse generator, which in turn creates the required reset pulses.\nIn embedded systems and control systems, watchdog timers are often used to activate fail-safe circuitry. When activated, the fail-safe circuitry forces all control outputs to safe states (e.g., turns off motors, heaters, and high-voltages) to prevent injuries and equipment damage while the fault persists. In a two-stage watchdog, the first timer is often used to activate fail-safe outputs and start the second timer stage; the second stage will reset the computer if the fault cannot be corrected before the timer elapses.\nWatchdog timers are sometimes used to trigger the recording of system state information—which may be useful during fault recovery—or debug information (which may be useful for determining the cause of the fault) onto a persistent medium. In such cases, a second timer—which is started when the first timer elapses—is typically used to reset the computer later, after allowing sufficient time for data recording to complete. This allows time for the information to be saved, but ensures that the computer will be reset even if the recording process fails.\n\nFor example, the above diagram shows a likely configuration for a two-stage watchdog timer. During normal operation the computer regularly kicks Stage1 to prevent a timeout. If the computer fails to kick Stage1 (e.g., due to a hardware fault or programming error), Stage1 will eventually timeout. This event will start the Stage2 timer and, simultaneously, notify the computer (by means of a non-maskable interrupt) that a reset is imminent. Until Stage2 times out, the computer may attempt to record state information, debug information, or both. As a last resort, the computer will be reset upon Stage2 timeout.\n\n\n== Fault detection ==\nA watchdog timer provides automatic detection of catastrophic malfunctions that prevent the computer from kicking it. However, computers can have other, less-severe types of faults which do not interfere with kicking, but which still require watchdog oversight. To support these, a computer system is typically designed so that its watchdog timer will be kicked only if the computer deems the system functional. The computer determines whether the system is functional by conducting one or more fault detection tests and will kick the watchdog only if all tests have passed.\n\nIn computers that are running an operating system and multiple processes, a single, simple test might be insufficient to guarantee normal operation, as it could fail to detect a subtle fault condition and consequently kick the watchdog even though a fault condition exists. For example, in the case of the Linux operating system, a user-space watchdog daemon may simply kick the watchdog periodically without performing any tests. As long as the daemon runs normally, the system will be protected against serious system crashes such as a kernel panic. To detect less severe faults, the daemon can perform tests that cover various aspects of the system condition, including resource availability (e.g., memory, file handles, CPU time), evidence of expected process activity (e.g., system daemons running, specific files being present or updated), overheating, and network activity.\nUpon discovery of a failed test, the computer may attempt to perform a sequence of corrective actions under software control, culminating with a software-initiated reboot. If the software fails to invoke a reboot, the hardware watchdog timer — if available — will timeout and invoke a hardware reset. In effect, this is a multistage watchdog timer in which the software comprises the first and the hardware WDT the final stage. In a Linux system, for example, the watchdog daemon can be configured to attempt to perform a software-initiated reboot, which may be preferable to a hardware reset as it allows file systems to be safely unmounted and fault information to be logged prior to the reboot. It is essential, however, to have the insurance provided by a hardware WDT, to allow for the case in which a fault causes the daemon itself to malfunction, and thus become unable to invoke a reboot.\n\n\n== Implementation ==\nWatchdog timers are implemented in various ways. Some electronic WDTs (e.g., Analog Devices MAX6324) use linear timing circuits that operate without a digital clock signal. Other electronic WDTs, and software WDTs, typically employ digital counters as timers and rely on a clock signal for proper operation.\n\n\n=== Electronic watchdogs ===\nElectronic WDTs are usually implemented either as a stand-alone integrated circuit (IC) or as part of a more complex IC. Some stand-alone implementations contain only a WDT, whereas others bundle a WDT with other functions (e.g. supply voltage supervisors) in a common IC.\nMany microcontrollers have a watchdog \"module\" consisting of a digital WDT and mechanisms for controlling and monitoring the WDT. Such modules typically include related control and status registers, circuitry for qualifying restart triggers (\"kicks\"), and routing control logic for the timeout signal. Some microcontrollers provide an analog WDT in lieu of a digital WDT. For example, Texas Instruments' TMS470 microcontroller has an analog WDT that employs an external capacitor and resistor to program the watchdog interval.\n\n\n==== Digital watchdogs ====\nIn microcontrollers and other complex digital ICs, a digital WDT is typically instantiated by synthesizing it from a description written in VHDL, Verilog or some other hardware description language. For example, the following VHDL code describes a simple WDT:\n\n\n==== Analog watchdogs ====\n\nAnalog WDTs have a kick input and timeout output, but lack the clock input signal found in digital electronic watchdogs.\nCircuitry and components vary widely among analog watchdogs, but in general, analog WDTs typically base their timing functions on capacitor charging rates. For example, in the analog watchdog circuit shown to the right, electric current i gradually charges capacitor C, causing voltage VC to ramp up (rise at a constant rate). In normal operation, periodic \"kick\" pulses are applied to the kick input. Each kick causes capacitor C to discharge, thus restarting the voltage ramp-up. However, if the kicks cease or become spaced too far apart in time, VC will rise above threshold voltage VTH and, as a result, the voltage comparator will assert the timeout signal.\n\n\n=== Software watchdogs ===\nSome software watchdog timers are implemented as standard software modules. Examples of these include \"Softdog\", a virtual device driver which emulates an electronic WDT and conforms to the Linux watchdog API, and MathWorks' Software Watchdog Timer, a retriggerable one-shot timer which can be instantiated by dragging its GUI representation onto a block diagram. Other software WDTs are typically custom-designed to meet specific requirements.\nEvery software WDT depends on a timing reference to allow it to accurately track the passage of time. Various mechanisms are commonly available for this purpose. Depending on the computer, and if used, the operating system (OS), such mechanisms may include programmable interval timers, kernel timers, the system clock, and synchronization objects (e.g., semaphores) that support timed waits.\nThe design of a software WDT can be influenced by a number of factors, including the length of the watchdog interval, the time references available for WDT use, CPU loading, how soon the WDT must be kicked after relevant conditions have been met, whether the computer is running an OS and, if so, whether the WDT is intended to run in user or kernel mode. For example, in bare metal applications (program running without an OS), timing references are often limited to programmable interval timers (PIT). In such cases, the WDT might be implemented with a PIT in a fashion similar to the flowchart shown below:\n\nIn the above example, if the application program fails to kick the watchdog (by restarting the PIT), the PIT will reach the end of the watchdog interval and generate an interrupt request (IRQ). The associated interrupt service routine (ISR) will then execute and take corrective action via programmed I/O, system calls, or other software-controlled operations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommand-loss timer\nSafe mode (spacecraft)\nDeadman timer\nPower-up timer\nHeartbeat (computing)\nKeepalive\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nArduino Watchdog Timer with Reset - Article by Adityapratap Singh", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:11:58Z"}

{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "179935", "title": "Bob Welch (musician)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Welch_(musician)", "content_length": 15151, "text": "Robert Lawrence Welch Jr. (August 31, 1945 – June 7, 2012) was an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter who was a member of Fleetwood Mac from 1971 to 1974. He had a successful solo career in the late 1970s. His singles included \"Hot Love, Cold World\", \"Ebony Eyes\", \"Precious Love\", \"Hypnotized\", and his signature song, \"Sentimental Lady\".\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWelch was born in Hollywood, California, into a show business family. His father, Robert L. Welch Sr., was a producer and screenwriter at Paramount Pictures, producing films starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Welch Sr. produced the 25th Annual Academy Awards TV special in 1953 and The Thin Man TV series from 1958 to 1959. Bob's mother, Templeton Fox, was a singer and actress who worked with Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre in Chicago and appeared in TV and movies from 1962 to 1979.\nWelch learned clarinet in his childhood, switching to guitar in his early teens. His interests were jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock music. He was accepted into Georgetown University, but instead moved to Paris, planning to attend the Sorbonne. Welch told People in a 1979 interview that, in Paris, \"I mostly smoked hash with bearded guys five years older\" and spent most of his time \"sitting in the Deux Magots café\". He returned to Southern California, where he briefly studied French at the University of California, Los Angeles, but did not complete a degree.\nIn 1964, Welch joined the Los Angeles-based vocal group The Seven Souls. The Seven Souls lost a battle of the bands competition, the prize being a contract with Epic Records, to Sly and the Family Stone. The Seven Souls' 1967 single \"I'm No Stranger\" made no impact at the time of its release, despite subsequent issue in France and Italy. Its B-side, \"I Still Love You\", has since become a Northern Soul anthem, with original copies selling up to £400. The Seven Souls broke up in 1969.\nWelch subsequently returned to Paris and started a trio, Head West, which was not a success. He later told People that his time in Paris (1969-1971) was \"living on rice and beans and sleeping on the floor.\"\n\n\n== Fleetwood Mac ==\nIn 1971, Welch auditioned for Fleetwood Mac at Benifold, their retreat and communal home in England. The band had recently lost one of its front-line members, guitarist Jeremy Spencer, and were looking for a replacement. Judy Wong, a friend and part-time secretary for the band, recommended her high school friend Welch. The band had a few meetings with Welch and decided to hire him, despite not having previously played with him, after listening to some of his songs on tape. Welch was assigned rhythm guitar, backing up lead guitarist Danny Kirwan. Welch also moved in to Benifold, in Hampshire.\nThe band's first album to feature Christine McVie and Welch, Future Games, was recorded at Advision Studios in London and released in September 1971, with the title track written by Welch. Six months later, in 1972, the band released Bare Trees, which was mostly recorded at De Lane Lea Studios in Wembley, London, and featured Welch's \"Sentimental Lady\". This song was a big hit for Welch five years later when he re-recorded it for his solo album French Kiss. Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham also sang on and produced the remake.\n\n\n=== Line-up changes ===\nThe band recorded their next two albums Penguin and Mystery to Me at Benifold using mobile equipment hired from the Rolling Stones. Throughout this period, Fleetwood Mac often changed band members around the core of Mick Fleetwood, the McVies and Welch. Kirwan was replaced as a vocalist by ex-Savoy Brown lead singer Dave Walker, and as a lead guitarist by Bob Weston. Both Walker and Weston played on Penguin. Released in January 1973, the album reached No. 49 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart in the United States. This album contained Welch's songs \"Bright Fire\", \"Revelation\", and \"Night Watch\".\nMystery to Me contained Welch's song \"Hypnotized\", which earned significant FM radio airplay in the US. However, as a result of an aborted tour, Mystery to Me only reached No. 67 in the States.\n\n\n=== 'Fake Mac' and Relocation to LA ===\nBy late 1973, internal stresses caused by a shifting line-up, touring, the deterioration of the McVies' marriage and an affair between Weston and Fleetwood's wife, Jenny Boyd, were debilitating to the band. Weston was sacked and the band quit a tour of the US.\nThe band's manager, Clifford Davis, refused to cancel the remaining 26 dates of the tour, fearing that this would destroy his reputation with bookers and promoters. In a letter to the remaining Fleetwood Mac members, he said he \"had not slaved for years to be brought down by the whims of irresponsible musicians\". He claimed that he owned the Fleetwood Mac name, and informed them of his plan to make the band into a new \"star-quality, headlining act\"—in effect firing them, but offering them jobs in the new band. Welch and the other band members did not take this seriously and ignored Davis's offer. Davis then set up a US tour with a new group of musicians—without Fleetwood Mac's consent—who were to be billed as \"The New Fleetwood Mac\". None of the new musicians had ever played with any previous incarnation of the band. Davis announced that Welch and John McVie had quit Fleetwood Mac, and that Fleetwood and Christine McVie would be joining the 'new' band at a later date. The original members of Fleetwood Mac obtained an injunction preventing the \"fake Mac\" from touring under their name, while Davis obtained an injunction preventing the original band from touring. The lawsuits resulting from the ultimately aborted tour put Fleetwood Mac out of commission for almost a year.\nDuring this limbo, Welch stayed in Los Angeles and connected with entertainment attorneys. Welch believed the band was being neglected by Warner Bros.—the parent of their label, Reprise Records—and convinced the band to move to Los Angeles. \nInstead of getting another manager, Fleetwood Mac decided to manage themselves. After the courts ruled that the \"Fleetwood Mac\" name belonged to Fleetwood and John McVie, the two band members set up their own band management company, Seedy Management.\n\n\n=== Heroes Are Hard to Find and departure from Fleetwood Mac ===\nIn 1974, Welch was the only guitar player in the band. Warner Bros. made a new deal with Fleetwood Mac, releasing the album Heroes Are Hard to Find on Reprise in September 1974. The album became the band's first to reach the Top 40 in the United States, peaking at No. 34 on the Billboard chart. The subsequent tour would be Welch's last with Fleetwood Mac.\nWelch was suffering with personal and professional issues: his marriage was failing, and he felt he had exhausted his creativity with the band. Later, he explained that he felt estranged from John and Christine McVie, yet close to Fleetwood; he asserted in 1974 that he was running the band. Welch resigned from Fleetwood Mac in December 1974 and was replaced by Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.\nOf the Fleetwood Mac albums on which Welch appeared, American album sales totaled 500,000 units shipped between 1971 and 2000 for Future Games; 1 million units of Bare Trees between 1972 and 1988; and 500,000 units of Mystery to Me between 1973 and 1976, when it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.\nWelch's relationship with his former band remained amicable in the years following his departure. During the height of their respective popularity in the late 1970s, Welch would frequently open for Fleetwood Mac and he would sit in as lead vocalist on \"Hypnotized\". Mick Fleetwood managed Welch's career into the 1980s.\n\n\n=== Lawsuit ===\nBy the 1990s, Welch's once diplomatic relationship with Fleetwood Mac had become acrimonious. In 1994, Welch sued Fleetwood, the McVies, band attorney Michael Shapiro and Warner Bros. Records for breach of contract related to underpayment of royalties. Previously, in 1978, Welch and the band had signed a contract with Warner Bros. agreeing to an equal share of all royalties from their Fleetwood Mac albums. Welch alleged that the members later made new deals with Warner Bros. for higher royalty rates, and neither Fleetwood nor the McVies had informed Welch, thus cheating him out of equal royalties. The lawsuit was settled in 1996.\n\n\n=== Hall of Fame controversy and reconciliation ===\nWhen Fleetwood Mac was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, original band members Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, Mick Fleetwood, and John McVie were named to the Hall, as were later additions Danny Kirwan, Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, and Stevie Nicks. Welch, who anchored the band for several years and five albums, was not. Welch felt the recent legal battle with the band soured the committee to include him. \"My era was the bridge era,\" Welch told the Cleveland newspaper the Plain Dealer in 1998. \"It was a transition. But it was an important period in the history of the band. Mick Fleetwood dedicated a whole chapter of his biography to my era of the band and credited me with 'saving Fleetwood Mac'. Now they want to write me out of the history of the group. It hurts... Mick and I co-managed the group for years. I'm the one who brought the band to Los Angeles from England, which put them in the position of hooking up with Lindsey and Stevie. I saw the band through a whole period where they barely survived, literally.\"\nIn a 2003 online question-and-answer session on the Fleetwood Mac fan site The Penguin, Welch revised his opinion about the exclusion. He had recently visited Fleetwood Mac backstage after a show, and he reconnected with Mick Fleetwood. Welch no longer blamed the band for his exclusion. He instead blamed the Hall's committee and its industry insiders (such as Ahmet Ertegun and Jann Wenner), stating they did not like his style of music. He still maintained that the lawsuit was a factor, as it prevented him from contacting Mick Fleetwood, and they were still estranged at the time of the induction.\n\n\n== Rock trio and solo career ==\nIn 1975, Welch formed the short-lived hard rock power trio Paris with ex-Jethro Tull bassist Glenn Cornick and former Nazz drummer Thom Mooney. With a guitar-driven aesthetic compared by retrospective critics to Led Zeppelin, Paris released two commercially unsuccessful albums: Paris and Big Towne, 2061. Hunt Sales later replaced Mooney until the group disbanded.\nIn a 1979 interview with People, Welch said that the two Paris albums were \"ill-conceived.\" The band's overhead and ensuing lack of commercial success drained Welch's finances, leaving him with only $8,000 in savings (equivalent to ~$35,000 in 2024) after its dissolution.\nIn September 1977, Welch released his first solo album, French Kiss, a mainstream pop collection featuring contributions from Fleetwood, Buckingham, and Christine McVie. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA, peaking at No. 12 on the Billboard chart in 1978. It yielded three hit singles: a revamped version of \"Sentimental Lady\" produced by Buckingham and McVie (#8), \"Ebony Eyes\" (#14; featuring Juice Newton on backing vocals) and \"Hot Love, Cold World\" (#31).\nWelch followed up French Kiss with two albums in 1979.  In February, Three Hearts, an album that replicated the rock/disco fusion of French Kiss, peaked at No. 20 (earning a RIAA gold certification) and spawned the hit \"Precious Love\" (#19), while the follow-up single \"Church\" (#73) also charted as his final U.S. Top 100 hit. His second effort that year, November's The Other One, contained his first solo recordings without any Fleetwood Mac members. Although the album reached No. 105 on the charts, none of its singles charted. Notable songs include \"Rebel Rouser\" and \"Don't Let Me Fall\". From 1980 to 1981, he hosted Hollywood Heartbeat, an early music video program. His subsequent solo albums into the early 1980s (Man Overboard, Bob Welch, and Eye Contact) were not successful; released approximately two years after \"Church\", Bob Welch only charted at No. 201.\nIn 1999, Welch released an experimental jazz/loop-based album, Bob Welch Looks at Bop. He followed this up in 2003 with His Fleetwood Mac Years and Beyond, which contained re-recordings of songs he originally performed with Fleetwood Mac, as well as some solo hits. In 2006, he released His Fleetwood Mac Years and Beyond 2, which mixed a half-dozen new compositions, along with a similar number of his Mac/solo remakes. He released more CDs with Fuel Records in 2008, 2010, and 2011.\nWelch appeared as an avatar named BobWelch Magic in 2008, performing solo acoustic favorites and hits live for 30 minutes, in a show with Von Johin (musician/publisher Mike Lawson) and Cypress Rosewood (musician Tony Gerber) in the virtual world of Second Life, streaming live into the Gibson Island virtual stage from Lawson's studio.\n\n\n== Recovery and second marriage ==\nFollowing the release of Eye Contact (which failed to chart), Welch took to partying with Guns N' Roses, who were rehearsing in his garage. He became addicted to cocaine and heroin, and was hospitalized for detox in spring of 1985. Welch reflected on that era as \"being a very bad boy, very decadent, very cynical, VERY stoned. It was not a good time.\"\nThe day he was released from detox, he was introduced to Wendy Armistead by Taryn Power (Tyrone Power's daughter) and Tony Sales at The Central (now The Viper Room). Welch and Armistead were married in December 1985 and moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to maintain Welch's sobriety. Welch abstained from all illegal drugs for the rest of his life.\nWhile in Phoenix, they formed a short-lived group called Avenue M. The group went on tour and recorded one song for a greatest hits compilation. Welch and Armistead later moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and remained married until his death.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nThree months before his death, Welch underwent spinal surgery. The procedure was unsuccessful and doctors told him his condition would not improve.\nOn June 7, 2012, around 6:00 a.m., Welch died by suicide, shooting himself in his Nashville home where his wife Wendy—for whom he left a nine-page suicide note and love letter—discovered his body. He was 66 years old.\nWendy died on November 28, 2016, from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, also aged 66.\nAn exhibit chronicling Welch's career opened at The Musicians Hall of Fame in Nashville on August 27, 2018. Despite the lawsuit over a decade earlier, Fleetwood wrote a tribute for the exhibit. Welch's estate has endowed a scholarship to support Belmont School of Music students.\n\n\n== Pop culture ==\nBob Welch is mentioned throughout episode one of season eighteen of Family Guy, called \"Yacht Rocky\". The main character, Peter Griffin, finds out that Welch has died and takes a moment to lie down and stare at the ceiling while listening to \"Sentimental Lady\". This repeats several times in the episode as different characters lament Welch's death.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Band work ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBob Welch discography at Discogs\nBob Welch at IMDb", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:11:59Z"}
{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "21026", "title": "Meat Loaf", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_Loaf", "content_length": 37448, "text": "Michael Lee Aday (born Marvin Lee Aday; September 27, 1947 – January 20, 2022), better known by his stage name Meat Loaf, was an American singer and actor. He was known for his powerful, wide-ranging voice and theatrical live shows. His Bat Out of Hell album trilogy—Bat Out of Hell (1977), Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell (1993), and Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose (2006)—has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The first album stayed on the charts for over nine years and is one of the best-selling albums in history, still selling an estimated 200,000 copies annually as of 2016.\nDespite the commercial success of Bat Out of Hell and Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell, and earning a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for the song \"I'd Do Anything for Love\", Meat Loaf nevertheless experienced some difficulty establishing a steady career within the United States. However, his career still saw success due to his popularity in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom and Ireland. He received the 1994 Brit Award in the United Kingdom for best-selling album and single, and was ranked 23rd for the number of weeks spent on the UK charts in 2006. He ranks 96th on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".\nMeat Loaf also acted in over 50 films and television shows, sometimes as himself or as characters resembling his stage persona. His notable film roles include Eddie in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), the bus driver in Spice World (1997), and Robert Paulson in Fight Club (1999). His early stage work included dual roles in the original Broadway cast of The Rocky Horror Show; he also appeared in the musical Hair, both on and Off-Broadway.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMarvin Lee Aday was born in Dallas, Texas, on September 27, 1947, the son of Wilma Artie (née Hukel), a schoolteacher and member of the Vo-di-o-do Girls gospel music quartet, and Orvis Wesley Aday, a former police officer who went into business selling a homemade cough remedy with his wife and a friend under the name of the Griffin Grocery Company. He stated in an interview that when he was born, he was \"bright red and stayed that way for days\" and that his father said he looked like \"nine pounds of ground chuck\", and convinced hospital staff to put the name \"Meat\" on his crib. He was later called \"M.L.\" in reference to his initials, but when his weight increased, his seventh-grade classmates referred to him as \"Meat Loaf\", referring to his then 5-foot-2-inch (157 cm), 240-pound (110 kg) stature. He also attributed the nickname to an incident where, after he stepped on a football coach's foot, the coach yelled \"Get off my foot, you hunk of meatloaf!\"\nMeat Loaf's father would binge-drink alcohol for days at a time, a habit he started when he was medically discharged from the U.S. Army during World War II after being wounded by fragments from a mortar shell. Meat Loaf often accompanied his mother in driving to the bars in Dallas to look for his father, and often stayed with his grandmother. He attended church and Bible study every Sunday.\nHe was 16 years old on November 22, 1963, the day of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. That morning, Meat Loaf had seen the President when he arrived at Dallas Love Field. Later, after hearing of Kennedy's death, he and a friend drove to Parkland Hospital where he witnessed Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, covered in her husband's blood, getting out of the car that brought her to the hospital.\nIn 1965, Meat Loaf graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School, having appeared in school stage productions such as Where's Charley? and The Music Man. He played high school football as a defensive tackle. After attending college at Lubbock Christian College, he transferred to North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas).\nIn 1967, when Meat Loaf was 19 years old, his mother died of cancer, and his father lunged at him with a knife after falsely accusing the teen of having girls in his bedroom. Meat Loaf used the money his mother left him to rent an apartment in Dallas, where he isolated for three and a half months, at which time a friend found him. Soon after, he went to the airport and caught the next flight to Los Angeles.\nMeat Loaf intentionally gained 60 pounds (27 kg) to fail his physical examination for the Vietnam War draft. Despite this strategy, he still received his notice to appear before his local draft board, but chose to ignore it.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nIn Los Angeles, Meat Loaf formed his first band, Meat Loaf Soul. The band received several recording contracts. Meat Loaf Soul's first gig was in Huntington Beach, California in 1968 at the Cave, opening for Van Morrison's band Them and Question Mark and the Mysterians. Meat Loaf later described his early days in the music industry as being treated like a \"circus clown.\"\nThe band underwent several changes of lead guitarists, changing the name of the band each time, to names including Popcorn Blizzard and Floating Circus. As Floating Circus, they opened for the Who, the Fugs, the Stooges, MC5, the Grateful Dead, and the Grease Band. Their regional success led them to release a single, \"Once Upon a Time\", backed with \"Hello\". Meat Loaf then joined the Los Angeles production of the musical Hair.\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\nWith the publicity generated from Hair, Meat Loaf accepted an invitation by Motown, in Detroit. In addition to appearing as \"Mother\" and \"Ulysses S. Grant\" at Detroit's Vest Pocket Theatre, he recorded  the vocals with fellow Hair performer Shaun \"Stoney\" Murphy on an album of songs written and selected by the Motown production team. The album, titled Stoney & Meatloaf (with Meatloaf spelled as one word), was released in September 1971 and included the single \"What You See Is What You Get\"; it reached number 36 on the Best Selling Soul Singles chart and number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Meat Loaf and Stoney toured with Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers, opening for Richie Havens, the Who, the Stooges, Bob Seger, Alice Cooper, and Rare Earth. Meat Loaf left Motown soon after the label replaced his and Stoney's vocals from the one song he liked, \"Who Is the Leader of the People?\" with new vocals by Edwin Starr. He moved to Freeland, Michigan, for a year and was the opening act at the Grande Ballroom 80 times.\nIn December 1972, Meat Loaf was in the original off-Broadway production of Rainbow at the Orpheum Theatre in New York. After the tour, Meat Loaf rejoined the cast of Hair, this time at a Broadway theater. After he hired an agent, he auditioned for the Public Theater's production of More Than You Deserve. During the audition, Meat Loaf met Jim Steinman. He sang a Stoney and Meat Loaf favorite of his, \"(I'd Love to Be) As Heavy as Jesus\", and subsequently got the part of Rabbit, a maniac that blows up his fellow soldiers so they can \"go home.\" Ron Silver and Fred Gwynne were also in the show. In the summer between the show's workshop production (April 1973) and full production (November 1973 – January 1974), Meat Loaf appeared in a Shakespeare in the Park production of As You Like It with Raul Julia and Mary Beth Hurt.\nIn late 1973, Meat Loaf was cast in the original L.A. Roxy cast of The Rocky Horror Show, playing the parts of both Eddie and Dr. Scott. The success of the musical led to the filming of The Rocky Horror Picture Show in which Meat Loaf played only Eddie while Jonathan Adams was cast as Dr. Scott, a decision Meat Loaf said made the movie not as good as the musical.\nAbout the same time, Meat Loaf and Steinman started work on Bat Out of Hell. Meat Loaf convinced Epic Records to shoot music videos for four songs, \"Bat Out of Hell\", \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\", \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth\", and \"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\" and convinced Lou Adler, the producer of Rocky Horror, to run the \"Paradise\" video as a trailer to the movie. During his recording of the soundtrack for Rocky Horror, Meat Loaf recorded two more songs: \"Stand by Me\" (a Ben E. King cover), and \"Clap Your Hands.\" They remained unreleased for a decade, until 1984, when they appeared as B-sides to the \"Nowhere Fast\" single.\nIn 1976, Meat Loaf recorded lead vocals for Ted Nugent's album Free-for-All when regular Nugent lead vocalist Derek St. Holmes temporarily quit the band. Meat Loaf sang lead on five of the album's nine tracks. That same year, Meat Loaf appeared in his final theatrical show in New York City, the short-lived Broadway production of Gower Champion's rock musical Rockabye Hamlet. It closed two weeks into its initial run.\n\nMeat Loaf and Steinman started working on Bat Out of Hell in 1972, but did not get serious about it until the end of 1974. Meat Loaf then decided to leave theater and concentrate exclusively on music. Meat Loaf was cast as an understudy for John Belushi in The National Lampoon Show. It was at the Lampoon show that Meat Loaf met Ellen Foley, the co-star who sang \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\" and \"Bat Out of Hell\" with him on the album Bat Out of Hell.\nMeat Loaf and Steinman spent time seeking a record deal; however, their approaches were rejected by each record company, because their songs did not fit any specific recognized music industry style. Todd Rundgren, under the impression that they already had a record deal, agreed to produce the album as well as play lead guitar along with other members of Rundgren's band Utopia and Max Weinberg. They then shopped the record around, but they still had no takers until Steve Popovich's Cleveland International Records took a chance, releasing Bat Out of Hell in October 1977.\nMeat Loaf and Steinman formed the band Neverland Express to tour in support of Bat Out of Hell. Their first gig was opening for Cheap Trick in Chicago. Meat Loaf gained national exposure as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on March 25, 1978. Host Christopher Lee introduced him with a groan worthy joke. In 1978, Meat Loaf jumped off a stage in Ottawa, Ontario, breaking his leg. He finished his tour performing in a wheelchair.\nBat Out of Hell has sold an estimated 43 million copies globally, including 15 million in the United States, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. In the United Kingdom alone, its 2.1 million sales put it in 38th place. Despite peaking at No. 9 and spending only two weeks in the top ten in 1981, it has now spent 485 weeks on the UK Albums Chart (May 2015), a figure bettered only by Rumours by Fleetwood Mac with 487 weeks. In Australia, it knocked the Bee Gees off the No. 1 spot and became the biggest-selling album of all time in that country. Bat Out of Hell has, as of December 2020, spent a total of 522 weeks in the Top 200 in the UK chart.\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn 1979, Steinman started to work on Bad for Good, the intended follow-up to 1977's Bat Out of Hell. During that time, a combination of touring, drugs and exhaustion had caused Meat Loaf to lose his voice. Without a singer, and pressured by the record company, Steinman decided that he should sing on Bad for Good himself. While Steinman worked on Bad for Good, Meat Loaf played the role of Travis Redfish in the movie Roadie until his singing voice returned. Steinman then wrote a new album for Meat Loaf, Dead Ringer, which was released in September 1981. Steinman had written five new songs which, in addition to the track \"More Than You Deserve\" (sung by Meat Loaf in the stage musical of the same name) and a reworked monologue, formed the album Dead Ringer, which was produced by Meat Loaf and Stephan Galfas, with backing tracks produced by Todd Rundgren, Jimmy Iovine, and Steinman. In 1976, Meat Loaf appeared on the track \"Keeper Keep Us\", from the Intergalactic Touring Band's self-titled album, produced by Galfas. The song \"Dead Ringer for Love\" was the pinnacle of the album, and launched Meat Loaf to even greater success. While it failed to chart in the US, it reached No. 5 in the United Kingdom and stayed in the UK Singles Chart for 19 weeks. Cher provided the lead female vocals in the song.\nOn December 5, 1981, Meat Loaf and the Neverland Express were the musical guests for Saturday Night Live where he and former fellow Rocky Horror Picture Show actor Tim Curry performed a skit depicting a One-Stop Rocky Horror Shop. Also on the show, Curry performed \"The Zucchini Song\" and Meat Loaf & the Neverland Express performed \"Bat Out of Hell\" and \"Promised Land.\"\nFollowing a dispute with his former songwriter Jim Steinman, Meat Loaf was contractually obliged to release a new album, resulting in Midnight at the Lost and Found, released in May 1983. According to Meat Loaf, Steinman had given the songs \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" and \"Making Love Out of Nothing at All\" to Meat Loaf for this album. However, Meat Loaf's record company did not want Meat Loaf to sing Steinman's songs, saying that nobody wanted to hear them. Bonnie Tyler's version of \"Eclipse\" and Air Supply's version of \"Making Love\" topped the charts together, holding No. 1 and No. 2 for a period during 1983. Meat Loaf is credited with having been involved in the writing of some of the tracks on the album, including the title track, \"Midnight at the Lost and Found.\"\nPoor money management as well as 45 lawsuits totaling US$80 million, including ones from Steinman, resulted in Meat Loaf filing for personal bankruptcy in 1983. The bankruptcy resulted in Meat Loaf losing the rights to his songs, although he received royalties for Bat Out of Hell in 1997.\nIn 1984, Meat Loaf went to England, where he felt increasingly at home, to record the album Bad Attitude; it was released that year. It features two songs by Steinman, both previously recorded, \"Nowhere Fast\" and \"Surf's Up.\" The American release on RCA Records was in April 1985 and features a slightly different track list, as well as alternate mixes for some songs. The title track features a duet with the Who's lead singer Roger Daltrey. It was a minor success with a few commercially successful singles, the most successful being \"Modern Girl\". In 1985, Meat Loaf took part in some comedy sketches in the UK with Hugh Laurie. Meat Loaf also tried stand-up comedy, appearing several times in Connecticut.\nMeat Loaf worked with songwriter John Parr on his next album, Blind Before I Stop, which was released in 1986 by Arista Records. It features production, mixing, and general influence by Frank Farian. Meat Loaf was involved in the composition of three of the songs on the album. Meat Loaf performed \"Thrashin\" for the soundtrack of the 1986 skateboarding film Thrashin' (directed by David Winters and starring Josh Brolin).\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nFollowing the success of Meat Loaf's touring in the 1980s, he and Steinman began work during December 1990 on Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell; the album was released in September 1993. The immediate success of Bat Out of Hell II led to the sale of over 15 million copies, and the single \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\" reached number one in 28 countries. In March 1994, at the 36th Annual Grammy Awards, Meat Loaf won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo for \"I'd Do Anything for Love.\" This song stayed at No. 1 in the UK chart for seven consecutive weeks. The single featured a female vocalist who was credited only as \"Mrs. Loud\". She was later identified as Lorraine Crosby, a performer from England. Meat Loaf promoted the song with American vocalist Patti Russo, who performed lead female vocals on tour with him. Also in 1994, he sang the U.S. national anthem \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He released the single \"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\", which reached No. 13 in the United States.\nIn 1995, Meat Loaf released his seventh studio album, Welcome to the Neighborhood. The album went platinum in the United States and the United Kingdom. It included three singles that hit the top 40, including \"I'd Lie for You (And That's the Truth)\" (which reached No. 13 in the United States and No. 2 in the UK), and \"Not a Dry Eye in the House\" (which reached No. 7 in the UK chart). I'd Lie for You (And That's the Truth) was a duet with Patti Russo, who had been touring with Meat Loaf and singing on his albums since 1993. Of the twelve songs on the album, two are written by Steinman. Both are cover versions, the \"Original Sin\" from Pandora's Box's Original Sin album and \"Left in the Dark\" first appeared on Steinman's own Bad for Good as well as the 1984 album Emotion by Barbra Streisand. His other singles, \"I'd Lie for You (And That's the Truth)\" and \"Not a Dry Eye in the House\", were written by Diane Warren.\nIn 1998, Meat Loaf released The Very Best of Meat Loaf. The album featured three new songs co-written by Steinman – two with Andrew Lloyd Webber and one with Don Black, \"Is Nothing Sacred\", released as a single. The single version of this song is a duet with Patti Russo, whereas the album version is a solo song by Meat Loaf.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\nIn 2003, Meat Loaf released his album Couldn't Have Said It Better. For only the third time in his career, Meat Loaf released an album without any songs written by Steinman (not counting live bonus tracks on special edition releases). Although Meat Loaf claimed that Couldn't Have Said It Better was \"the most perfect album [he] did since Bat Out of Hell\", it was not as commercially successful. The album was a minor commercial success worldwide and reached No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart, accompanied by a sellout world tour to promote the album and some of Meat Loaf's best selling singles. One such performance on his world tour was at the 2003 NRL Grand Final in Sydney. There were many writers for the album including Diane Warren and James Michael, who were both asked to contribute to his 2006 album, Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose. The album featured duets with Patti Russo and Meat Loaf's daughter Pearl Aday.\nOn November 17, 2003, during a performance at London's Wembley Arena, on his Couldn't Have Said It Better tour, he collapsed of what was later diagnosed as Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, a condition marked by an extra electrical pathway in the heart which causes symptoms like a rapid heartbeat. The following week, he underwent a surgical procedure intended to correct the problem. As a result, Meat Loaf's insurance agency did not allow him to perform for any longer than one hour and 45 minutes.\nFrom February 20 to 22, 2004, during an Australian tour, Meat Loaf performed with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, in a set of concerts recorded for the album Bat Out of Hell: Live with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The performances included the Australian Boys' Choir singing back-up on a Couldn't Have Said It Better track, \"Testify.\"\nMeat Loaf and Steinman had begun to work on the third installment of Bat Out of Hell when Steinman suffered a heart attack. According to Meat Loaf, Steinman was too ill to work on such an intense project while Steinman's manager said health was not an issue.\nSteinman had registered the phrase \"Bat Out of Hell\" as a trademark in 1995. In May 2006, Meat Loaf sued Steinman and his manager in federal District Court in Los Angeles, seeking $50 million and an injunction against Steinman's use of the phrase. Steinman and his representatives attempted to block the album's release. An agreement was reached in July 2006. Denying reports in the press over the years of a rift between Meat Loaf and Steinman, in an interview with Dan Rather, Meat Loaf stated that he and Steinman never stopped talking, and that the lawsuits reported in the press were between lawyers and managers, and not between Meat Loaf and Steinman.\nThe album Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose was released on October 31, 2006, and was produced by Desmond Child. The first single from the album \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" (featuring Marion Raven) was released on October 16, 2006. It entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 6, giving Meat Loaf his highest UK chart position in nearly 11 years. The album debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, and sold 81,000 copies in its opening week, but after that did not sell as well in the United States and yielded no hit singles, although it was certified gold. The album also featured duets with Patti Russo and Jennifer Hudson. In the weeks following the release of Bat III, Meat Loaf and the Neverland Express did a brief tour of the U.S. and Europe, known as the Bases are Loaded Tour. In October 2006, Meat Loaf's private jet had to make an emergency landing at London Stansted Airport after the plane's forward landing gear failed.\nIn 2007, Meat Loaf began The Seize the Night Tour, with Marion Raven, serving as a supporting act. Portions of the tour in February 2007 were featured in the documentary Meat Loaf: In Search of Paradise, directed by Bruce David Klein. The film was an official selection of the Montreal World Film Festival in 2007. It opened in theaters in March 2008 and was released on DVD in May 2008.\n\nDuring a performance at the Metro Radio Arena in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, on October 31, 2007, at the opening of \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\" Meat Loaf walked off the stage early in the song and said that it was his last performance. His tour promoter, Andrew Miller, said that it was a result of \"exhaustion and stress\" and said that Meat Loaf would continue touring after suitable rest. The next two gigs in the tour, at the NEC and Manchester Evening News Arena were canceled because of \"acute laryngitis\" and were rescheduled for late November. The concert scheduled for November 6, 2007, at London's Wembley Arena was also canceled. Meat Loaf canceled his entire European tour for 2007 after being diagnosed with a cyst on his vocal cords.\nOn June 27, 2008, Meat Loaf began The Casa de Carne Tour in Plymouth, England alongside his longtime duet partner Patti Russo, who debuted one of her own original songs during the show. The tour continued through July and August with twenty dates throughout England, Ireland, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. Six U.S. shows were also added for October and December 2008.\nIn May 2009, Meat Loaf began work on the album Hang Cool Teddy Bear in the studio with Green Day's American Idiot album producer Rob Cavallo, working with such writers as Justin Hawkins, Rick Brantley, Ollie Wride, Tommy Henriksen, and Jon Bon Jovi. The album is based on the story of a fictional soldier, whose \"story\" furnishes the theme. The album is based on a short story by the Los Angeles-based screenwriter and director Kilian Kerwin, a long-time friend of the singer. Hugh Laurie and Jack Black both perform on the album, Laurie plays piano on the song \"If I Can't Have You\", while Black sings a duet with Meat Loaf on \"Like A Rose\". Patti Russo and Kara DioGuardi also duet on the album. Brian May of Queen features on guitar along with Steve Vai. It received positive reviews from critics and fans alike. The first single from the album, \"Los Angeloser\", was released for download on April 5 with the album charting at number 4 in the UK Albums Chart on April 25, 2010. The Hang Cool Tour followed in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. Patti Russo accompanied him on the tour, continuing through mid-2011.\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\n\nHell in a Handbasket, released in October 2011 for Australia and New Zealand, and February 2012 for the rest of the world, was recorded and produced by Paul Crook; Doug McKean did the mix with input from Rob Cavallo. The album features songs called \"All of Me\", \"Blue Sky\", \"The Giving Tree\", \"Mad, Mad World\", and a duet with Patti Russo called \"Our Love and Our Souls.\"\nAt the 2011 AFL Grand Final, the pre-match entertainment was headlined by a 12-minute medley performed by Meat Loaf. The performance was panned as the worst in the 34-year history of AFL Grand Final pre-game entertainment in a multitude of online reviews by football fans and Australian sport commentators. Meat Loaf responded by calling online critics \"butt-smellers\", and the AFL \"jerks\", vowing to convince other artists not to play at the event.\nIn 2011, Meat Loaf planned to release a Christmas album called Hot Holidays featuring Garth Brooks and Reba McEntire, but the album was never released.\nMeat Loaf collapsed on stage while performing in Edmonton, Canada on June 16, 2016.\nIn September 2016, Braver Than We Are, a 10-track album created with Jim Steinman, was released. Meat Loaf recorded reworked versions of Steinman's songs \"Braver Than We Are\", \"Speaking in Tongues\", \"Who Needs the Young\", and \"More\" (previously recorded by the Sisters of Mercy) for the album. Additionally, the song \"Prize Fight Lover\", originally issued as a download-only bonus track for Hang Cool Teddy Bear, was re-recorded for the album.\n\n\n=== Later projects and Jim Steinman's death ===\nIn January 2020, during an interview for The Mirror, Meat Loaf announced, \"I'm not old. I've got songs for another record and I'm reading a script.\" In a February 2020 Facebook post, Meat Loaf announced his intention to record a new album containing 'four or five new tracks', including Steinman's \"What Part of My Body Hurts the Most\" (a song long requested by fans, but previously under contract restrictions for the Bat Out of Hell musical), along with the original 1975 demo recordings made for the Bat Out of Hell album. Meat Loaf's longtime collaborator Jim Steinman died on April 19, 2021, of kidney failure.\nIn a Facebook post in November 2021, he further elaborated that he and his band would be returning to the studio in January 2022 to record seven new songs for a forthcoming album, which would also include live tracks from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. However, on January 20, 2022, he died at age 74.

Edmonds, was working as a secretary at Bearsville Studios; they were married in early 1979. From a previous marriage, Leslie had a daughter named Pearl, who later married Anthrax rhythm guitarist Scott Ian. Meat Loaf adopted Pearl in 1979, and her last name was changed to Aday. \nAlso in 1979, he and his family moved to a house on Eagle Drive in Stamford, Connecticut. In 1981, Leslie gave birth to Amanda Aday, who later became a television actress. For a brief time after Amanda's birth, they lived in Westport, Connecticut.

He lived on Orchard Drive in Redding, Connecticut, from 1989 to 1998. He had also lived on Beach Road in Fairfield, Connecticut. In February 1998, the family purchased a house in Beverly Hills, California for $1.6 million. Meat Loaf and Leslie divorced in 2001.\nIn 2001, he sold his 5,083-square-foot house in Mandeville Canyon near Los Angeles to Greg Kinnear for $3.6 million.

Before his death, he lived in Brentwood, Tennessee.\n\n\n=== Name change ===\nIn 1984, Meat Loaf legally changed his first name from Marvin to Michael because he was \"haunted\" by a Levi Strauss & Co. commercial which—according to him—contained the line \"Poor fat Marvin can't wear Levi's.\"\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nMeat Loaf was a fan of the New York Yankees. He got Phil Rizzuto to recite the play-by-play of a young man racing around the bases in \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\". He participated in multiple fantasy baseball leagues every season. He also expressed support for the English Association football team Hartlepool United F.C.

He also said that he spent time with fellow musicians mainly in work-related situations rather than social ones. He also said that as a kid, \"Being too fat to play with the other children, I had to spend a lot of time alone, which probably has a lot to do with the way I am today. I'm usually alone in my hotel room from right after the show until the next day's sound check. And I'm never bored; I don't get bored. Probably because mothers wouldn't let their kids play with me.\"\n\n\n=== Vegetarianism ===\nMeat Loaf was a vegetarian from 1981 to 1992. Discussing the confusion caused by his contrasting stage name and dietary habits, he once told Entertainment Weekly, \"There've been vegetarians who wouldn't speak to me because of my name. I was sitting with Jon Bon Jovi at one of those awards things, and I say, 'Oh, man, I love k.d. lang. I'd really like to meet her.' They went to find out if it was okay, and she goes, 'No. His name is Meat Loaf.' I stopped being a k.d. lang fan after that.\" He declared in 2019 that he would try veganism for Veganuary in 2020 and would be partnering with UK restaurant chain Frankie & Benny's to promote its vegan options.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAlthough he did not belong to any faith-based institution, Meat Loaf was religious. While growing up, he attended church with his mother and studied the Bible, which influenced his work. Several of his songs, such as \"40 Days\" and \"Fall from Grace\", have religious themes. He prayed every night.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\n\n==== Political affiliations ====\nMeat Loaf was not officially registered with any political party.

He donated to the presidential campaigns of Republican candidates Rick Santorum and John McCain, the latter of whom became the party's nominee in the 2008 United States presidential election.\nOn October 25, 2012, Meat Loaf endorsed Mitt Romney for president, citing poor Russia–United States relations as a major reason he had been \"arguing for Mitt Romney for a year.\" He said, \"I have never been in any political agenda in my life, but I think that in 2012 this is the most important election in the history of the United States.\" He then said there are \"storm clouds\" over the United States and \"thunder storms\" over Europe: \"There are hail storms – and I mean major hail storms! – in the Middle East. There are storms brewing through China, through Asia, through everywhere.\" The same day, he performed \"America the Beautiful\" standing next to Romney.\nIn a 2017 interview with Billboard, he made positive remarks about President Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr.; they had worked together on The Celebrity Apprentice in 2011. When asked during an episode of The Celebrity Apprentice if he would vote for Trump, Meat Loaf said: \"I would vote for you. In fact, I'll help you with your campaign.\" Though months after that, according to a 2020 interview, he had a confrontation with Trump over a response to a journalist implying that Trump would be better as a financial advisor than a president. He recalls saying \"You’re not running for President, back off man!\" and said of the event \"I stood up to him because I’m really not afraid of him\".\n\n\n==== Climate change views ====\nMeat Loaf said that he did not believe in climate change. In an interview with the Daily Mail in 2020, he called Greta Thunberg \"brainwashed\" due to her views on climate change, saying: \"I feel for that Greta. She has been brainwashed into thinking that there is climate change and there isn't. She hasn't done anything wrong but she's been forced into thinking that what she is saying is true.\"\n\n\n==== Criticism of COVID-19 rules ====\nHe was critical of the COVID-19 lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, telling the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in August 2021: \"I hug people in the middle of COVID ... I understood stopping life for a little while, but they cannot continue to stop life because of politics.\" He opposed mask mandates and described a person who called for people on airplanes to wear masks as a \"Nazi\" and \"power-mad.\" Meat Loaf then said: \"If I die, I die, but I'm not going to be controlled.\" While no official cause of death has been announced, it is speculated that he did die of COVID-19.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nIn 2003, Meat Loaf was diagnosed with Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, a condition marked by an extra electrical pathway in the heart that causes symptoms like a rapid heartbeat. Meat Loaf had asthma and, in July 2011, he fainted on stage while performing in Pittsburgh due to an asthma attack.\nHe collapsed again while on stage in Edmonton in June 2016 due to severe dehydration, after having already canceled two other shows due to illness. The playback containing his pre-recorded, voice-over vocal track continued while he lay unconscious on the stage, which caused controversy over lip syncing, claims that Meat Loaf denied, saying that his mic was live. After the incident, Meat Loaf used acupuncture, physical therapy and a trainer for four days a week, an hour and a half each session. Meat Loaf had emergency back surgery in November 2016 including a spinal fusion due to a cyst that was pinching nerves, and in 2019, he was using a cane and a wheelchair to get around.\nAt the 2019 Texas Frightmare Weekend at the Hyatt Regency DFW hotel, Meat Loaf fell off an interview stage and broke his clavicle. Meat Loaf and his wife sued Texas Frightmare Weekend and Hyatt due to the accident.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nMeat Loaf died in Nashville, Tennessee, on the evening of January 20, 2022, at the age of 74. No official cause of death was released. He was reportedly ill with COVID-19 earlier in January, and reporting by TMZ suggested that he died from COVID-19 complications. As his health rapidly declined, his two daughters rushed to see him in the hospital with his wife beside him as he died. His daughter had posted to Instagram in early January that: \"We are not sick, but we have too many friends and family testing positive [for COVID-19] right now, positive but doing OK.\" Notable people who posted tributes include Bonnie Tyler, Cher, Brian May, Boy George, Travis Tritt, Marlee Matlin, Stephen Fry, and his Rocky Horror co-star Nell Campbell. The Queen's Guard performed a rendition of \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That).\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Books ==\nMeat Loaf (1999).

Symptoms vary from none to feeling tired, leg swelling, and shortness of breath. It may also result in chest pain or fainting. Complications can include heart failure, heart valve disease, or an irregular heartbeat.\nCauses include genetics, alcohol, cocaine, certain toxins, complications of pregnancy, and certain infections. Coronary artery disease and high blood pressure may play a role, but are not the primary cause. In many cases the cause remains unclear. It is a type of cardiomyopathy, a group of diseases that primarily affects the heart muscle. The diagnosis may be supported by an electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, or echocardiogram.\nIn those with heart failure, treatment may include medications in the ACE inhibitor, beta blocker, and diuretic families. A low salt diet may also be helpful. In those with certain types of irregular heartbeat, blood thinners or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator may be recommended. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may be necessary. If other measures are not effective a heart transplant may be an option in some.\nDuring the last two decades, there has been an increase in the number of patients diagnosed, and DCM represents the most common form of cardiomyopathy in adults. The most recent figures indicate that about 3 per 1,000 men and 1 per 1,000 women are affected. It is associated with a substantial excess mortality compared with the general population, ranging from about a 32-fold higher mortality in the youngest adults with DCM to about a 2-fold increase in the oldest patients. It can also occur in children and is the most common type of cardiomyopathy in this age group.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy develops insidiously, and may not initially cause symptoms significant enough to impact on quality of life. Nevertheless, many people experience significant symptoms. These might include:\n\nShortness of breath\nSyncope (fainting)\nAngina, but only in the presence of ischemic heart disease\nA person who has dilated cardiomyopathy may have an enlarged heart, with pulmonary edema and an elevated jugular venous pressure and a low pulse pressure. Signs of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation may be present.\n\n\n== Causes ==\nAlthough in many cases no cause is apparent, dilated cardiomyopathy is probably the result of damage to the myocardium produced by a variety of toxic, metabolic, or infectious agents. In many cases the cause remains unclear. It may be due to fibrous change of the myocardium from a previous myocardial infarction. Or, it may be the late sequelae of acute viral myocarditis, such as with Coxsackie B virus and other enteroviruses possibly mediated through an immunologic mechanism. Specific autoantibodies are detectable in some cases.\nOther causes include:\n\nChagas disease, due to Trypanosoma cruzi. This is the most common infectious cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in Latin America\nPregnancy: Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs late in gestation or several weeks to months postpartum as a peripartum cardiomyopathy. It is reversible in half of cases.\nAlcohol use disorder (alcoholic cardiomyopathy)\nNon-alcoholic toxic insults include administration of certain chemotherapeutic agents, in particular doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cobalt.\nThyroid disease\nInflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis and connective tissue diseases\nTachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy\nMuscular dystrophy\nTuberculosis: 1 to 2% of TB cases.\nAutoimmune mechanisms\nThiamine deficiency\nRecent studies have shown that those subjects with an extremely high occurrence (several thousands a day) of premature ventricular contractions (extrasystole) can develop dilated cardiomyopathy. In these cases, if the extrasystole are reduced or removed (for example, via ablation therapy) the cardiomyopathy usually regresses.\n\n\n=== Genetics ===\n\nAbout 25–35% of affected individuals have familial forms of the disease, with most mutations affecting genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins, while some affect other proteins involved in contraction. The disease is genetically heterogeneous, but the most common form of its transmission is an autosomal dominant pattern. Autosomal recessive (as found, for example, in Alström syndrome), X-linked (as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy), and mitochondrial inheritance of the disease is also found. Some relatives of those affected by dilated cardiomyopathy have preclinical, asymptomatic heart-muscle changes.\nOther cytoskeletal proteins involved in DCM include α-cardiac actin, desmin, and the nuclear lamins A and C. Mitochondrial deletions and mutations presumably cause DCM by altering myocardial ATP generation. Nuclear coding variations for mitochondrial complex II have also shown pathogenicity for dilated cardiomyopathy, designated 1GG for SDHA.\nKayvanpour et al. performed 2016 a meta-analysis with the largest dataset available on genotype-phenotype associations in DCM and mutations in lamin (LMNA), phospholamban (PLN), RNA Binding Motif Protein 20 (RBM20), Cardiac Myosin Binding Protein C (MYBPC3), Myosin Heavy Chain 7 (MYH7), Cardiac Troponin T 2 (TNNT2), and Cardiac Troponin I (TNNI3). They also reviewed recent studies investigating genotype-phenotype associations in DCM patients with titin (TTN) mutations. LMNA and PLN mutation carriers showed a high prevalence of cardiac transplantation and ventricular arrhythmia. Dysrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) was shown to occur even before the manifestation of DCM and heart failure symptoms in LMNA mutation carriers.\n\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\n\nThe progression of heart failure is associated with left ventricular remodeling, which manifests as gradual increases in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, wall thinning, and a change in chamber geometry to a more spherical, less elongated shape. This process is usually associated with a continuous decline in ejection fraction. The concept of cardiac remodeling was initially developed to describe changes that occur in the days and months following myocardial infarction.\n\n\n=== Compensation effects ===\nAs DCM progresses, two compensatory mechanisms are activated in response to impaired myocyte contractility and reduced stroke volume:\n\nFrank-Starling law\nNeurohormonal feedback, via activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system.\nThese responses initially compensate for decreased cardiac output and maintain those with DCM as asymptomatic. Eventually, however, these mechanisms become detrimental, intravascular volume becomes too great, and progressive dilatation leads to heart failure symptoms.\n\n\n=== Computational models ===\nCardiac dilatation is a transversely isotropic, irreversible process resulting from excess strains on the myocardium. A computation model of volumetric, isotropic, and cardiac wall growth predicts the relationship between cardiac strains (e.g. volume overload after myocardial infarction) and dilation using the following governing equations:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        =\n        \n          F\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          F\n          \n            g\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F=F^{e}\\cdot F^{g}\\,}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F^{e}}\n  \n is elastic volume stretch that is reversible and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          \n            g\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F^{g}}\n  \n is irreversible, isotropic volume growth described by:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          \n            g\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          I\n        \n        +\n        [\n        \n          λ\n          \n            g\n          \n        \n        −\n        1\n        ]\n        \n          f\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ⊗\n        \n          f\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F^{g}=\\mathbb {I} +[\\lambda ^{g}-1]f_{0}\\otimes f_{0}\\,}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f_{0}}\n  \n is a vector, which points along a cardiomyocyte's long axis and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          λ\n          \n            g\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda ^{g}}\n  \n is the cardiomyocyte stretch due to growth.

Dilation manifests itself in an increase in total cardiac mass and cardiac diameter. Cardiomyocytes reach their maximum length of 150 \n  \n    \n      \n        μ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  \nm in the endocardium and 130 \n  \n    \n      \n        μ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  \nm in the epicardium by the addition of sarcomeres.  Due to the increase in diameter, the dilated heart appears spherical in shape, as opposed the elliptical shape of a healthy human heart. In addition, the ventricular walls maintain the same thickness, characteristic of pathophysiological cardiac dilation.\n\n\n=== Valvular effects ===\nAs the ventricles enlarge, both the mitral and tricuspid valves may lose their ability to come together properly. This loss of coaptation may lead to mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. As a result, those with DCM are at increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, stroke volume is decreased and a greater volume load is placed on the ventricle, thus increasing heart failure symptoms.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\nGeneralized enlargement of the heart is seen upon normal chest X-ray. Pleural effusion may also be noticed, which is due to pulmonary venous hypertension.\nThe electrocardiogram often shows sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, left atrial enlargement, and sometimes intraventricular conduction defects and low voltage. When left bundle-branch block (LBBB) is accompanied by right axis deviation (RAD), the rare combination is considered to be highly suggestive of dilated or congestive cardiomyopathy. Echocardiogram shows left ventricular dilatation with normal or thinned walls and reduced ejection fraction. Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography are often performed to exclude ischemic heart disease.\nGenetic testing can be important, since one study has shown that gene mutations in the TTN gene (which codes for a protein called titin) are responsible for \"approximately 25% of familial cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 18% of sporadic cases.\" The results of the genetic testing can help the doctors and patients understand the underlying cause of the dilated cardiomyopathy. Genetic test results can also help guide decisions on whether a patient's relatives should undergo genetic testing (to see if they have the same genetic mutation) and cardiac testing to screen for early findings of dilated cardiomyopathy.\nCardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac MRI) may also provide helpful diagnostic information in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\n\n\n=== Medical therapy ===\nDrug therapy can slow down progression and in some cases even improve the heart condition. Standard therapy may include salt restriction, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and beta blockers. Anticoagulants may also be used for antithrombotic therapy. There is some evidence for the benefits of coenzyme Q10 in treating heart failure.\nK-strophanthin may improve functional performance in patients with severe cardiac decompensation while digoxin raises cardiac output and ejection fraction only at rest.\n\n\n=== Electrical treatment ===\nArtificial pacemakers may be used in patients with intraventricular conduction delay, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in those at risk of arrhythmia. These forms of treatment have been shown to prevent sudden cardiac death, improve symptoms, and reduce hospitalization in patients with systolic heart failure. In addition, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator should be considered as a therapeutic option for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with a confirmed LMNA mutation responsible for dilated cardiomyopathy disease phenotype and clinical risk factors. A novel risk score calculator has been developed that allows calculation of risk of sustained ventricular arrhythmia in the next 5 years in patients with DCM. https://www.ikard.pl/SVA/ Archived 2021-11-16 at the Wayback Machine\n\n\n=== Surgical treatment ===\nIn patients with advanced disease who are refractory to medical therapy, heart transplantation may be considered. For these people, 1-year survival approaches 90% and over 50% survive more than 20 years.\n\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nAlthough the disease is more common in African-Americans than in Caucasians, it may occur in any patient population.\n\n\n== Research directions ==\nTherapies that support reverse remodeling have been investigated, and this may suggests a new approach to the prognosis of cardiomyopathies (see ventricular remodeling).\n\n\n== Animals ==\nIn some types of animals, both a hereditary and acquired version of dilated cardiomyopathy has been documented.\n\n\n=== Dogs ===\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a heritable disease in some dog breeds, including the Boxer, Dobermann, Great Dane, Irish Wolfhound, and St Bernard. Treatment is based on medication, including ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors.\nAn acquired variation of dilated cardiomyopathy describing a link between certain diets was discovered in 2019 by researchers at University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine who published a report on the development of dilated cardiomyopathy in dog breeds lacking the genetic predisposition, particularly in Golden Retrievers. The diets associated with DCM were described as \"BEG\" (boutique, exotic-ingredient, and/or grain-free) dog foods, as well as legume-rich diets. For treating diet-related DCM, food changes,  taurine and carnitine supplementation may be indicated even if the dog does not have a documented taurine or carnitine deficiency although the cost of carnitine supplementation may be viewed as prohibitive by some\n\n\n=== Cats ===\nDilated cardiomyopathy is also a disease affecting some cat breeds, including the Oriental Shorthair, Burmese, Persian, and Abyssinian.  In cats, taurine deficiency is the most common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. As opposed to these hereditary forms, non-hereditary DCM used to be common in the overall cat population before the addition of taurine to commercial cat food.\n\n\n=== Other animals ===\nThere is also a high incidence of heritable dilated cardiomyopathy in captive golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), due in no small part to their being highly inbred. The incidence is high enough that several strains of Golden Hamster have been developed to serve as animal models in clinical testing for human forms of the disease.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy Archived 2013-05-25 at the Wayback Machine information for parents.", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:12:02Z"}

It is associated with kosher-style delicatessens but is not kosher, as it combines meat and cheese.\n\n\n== Possible origins ==\nOne origin story holds that Reuben Kulakofsky (his first name sometimes spelled Reubin; his last name sometimes shortened to Kay), a Lithuanian-born Jewish grocer residing in Omaha, Nebraska, asked for a sandwich made of corned beef and sauerkraut at his weekly poker game held in the Blackstone Hotel from around 1920 through 1935. The participants, who nicknamed themselves \"the committee\", included the hotel's owner, Charles Schimmel. Schimmel's son, who worked in the kitchen, made the first Reuben for him, adding Swiss cheese and thousand island dressing to his order, putting the whole thing on rye bread. The sandwich first gained local fame when Schimmel put it on the Blackstone's lunch menu, and its fame spread when a former employee of the hotel won the national sandwich idea contest with the recipe. In Omaha, March 14 was proclaimed Reuben Sandwich Day.\nAnother account holds that the Reuben's creator was Arnold Reuben, the German-Jewish owner of Reuben's Delicatessen (1908–2001) in New York City. According to an interview with Craig Claiborne, Arnold Reuben created the \"Reuben Special\" around 1914.  Bernard Sobel in his 1953 book, Broadway Heartbeat: Memoirs of a Press Agent states that the sandwich was an extemporaneous creation for Marjorie Rambeau, inaugurated when the Broadway actress visited the Reuben's Delicatessen one night when the cupboards were particularly bare.\nStill other versions give credit to Alfred Scheuing, a chef at Reuben's Delicatessen, and say he created the sandwich for Reuben's son, Arnold Jr., in the 1930s.\n\n\n== Variations ==\n\n\n=== Montreal Reuben ===\n\nThe Montreal Reuben substitutes Montreal-style smoked meat for the corned beef.\n\n\n=== Thousand Island dressing ===\nThousand Island dressing is commonly used as a substitute for Russian dressing.\n\n\n=== Walleye Reuben ===\nThe walleye Reuben features the freshwater fish (Sander vitreus) in place of the corned beef.\n\n\n=== Grouper Reuben ===\nThe grouper Reuben is a variation on the standard Reuben sandwich, substituting grouper for the corned beef, and sometimes coleslaw for the sauerkraut as well.  This variation is often a menu item in restaurants in Florida.\n\n\n=== Reuben egg rolls ===\nReuben egg rolls, sometimes called \"Irish egg rolls\" or \"Reuben balls\", use the standard Reuben sandwich filling of corned beef, sauerkraut, and cheese inside a deep-fried egg roll wrapper. Typically served with Thousand Island dressing (instead of Russian dressing) as an appetizer or snack, they originated at Mader's, a German restaurant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where chef Dennis Wegner created them for a summer festival circa 1990.\n\n\n=== Rachel sandwich ===\nThe Rachel sandwich is a variation which substitutes pastrami or turkey for the corned beef, and coleslaw for the sauerkraut. In some parts of the United States, especially Michigan, this turkey variant is known as a \"Georgia Reuben\" or \"California Reuben\", and it may also call for barbecue sauce or French dressing instead of Russian dressing. The name may have originated from the 1871 song \"Reuben and Rachel\".\n\n\n=== Dinty Moore sandwich ===\nThe Dinty Moore is a variation which substitutes the sauerkraut with coleslaw. It is particularly popular in the greater Detroit, Michigan area.\n\n\n=== Vegetarian and vegan versions ===\nVegetarian versions, called \"veggie Reubens\", omit the corned beef or substitute vegetarian ingredients for it, including zucchini, cucumbers, wheatmeat, and mushrooms. Vegan versions can use the aforementioned wheatmeat also known as seitan, tempeh or mushrooms with non-dairy cheese, dressing and butter.\n\n\n=== Kosher versions ===\nAs a Reuben combines both meat and dairy ingredients in the same meal, it is not kosher. However, it is frequently served at kosher style restaurants. Kosher versions may be made by removing the cheese, using non-dairy imitation cheese, or substituting the corned beef with a rabbinically supervised alternative.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of American sandwiches\nList of sandwiches\nPastrami on rye\nSloppy joe (New Jersey)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:12:03Z"}

She would often visit her cousins in Quincy, Lewis County, Kentucky, which has found its way into many of her books as the fictional Bybanks, Kentucky. Bybanks appears in Walk Two Moons, Chasing Redbird, and Bloomability, and there is an allusion to it in The Wanderer.\nAt college in the U.S. she became intrigued by story-telling after taking literature and writing courses, and she later became a teacher of secondary school English and Writing in England and Switzerland. Her first children's novel, Absolutely Normal Chaos, was published only in the U.K., by Macmillan Children's Books in 1990. Called \"comedy about contemporary teen life\" by Kirkus Reviews, it featured a 13-year-old girl's \"complete and unabridged journal for English class\". Her first book published in the U.S. was Walk Two Moons (1994), which won the American Newbery Medal in 1995. Later that year, Absolutely Normal Chaos was first published in the U.S. by HarperCollins —set in her hometown Euclid, Ohio.\nCreech returned to the U.S. in 1998 after 18 years abroad. She is married to Lyle Rigg, a headmaster in New Jersey, and has two grown children, Rob and Karin.\n\n\n== Books ==\nShe has written both novels and picture books. She often embeds serious topics into her stories, including such themes as independence, trust, childhood, adulthood, and death, often using humour to soften them.\nBooks such as Love That Dog and Heartbeat were written in verse, whereas other books like Ruby Holler and Walk Two Moons are in a narrative style.\nBloomability (1998) features an American girl at a boarding school in Switzerland. The setting was inspired by The American School In Switzerland, where Creech taught English.\nShe returned to the fictional school exercise in Love That Dog (Harper Collins and Bloomsbury, 2001), the blank verse diary of \"Jack, a reluctant student, [who] resists poetry assignments from his teacher, Miss Stretchberry.\" It was a commended runner-up for the British Carnegie Medal.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 1995, Walk Two Moons won the Newbery Medal from the American Library Association, recognizing the year's best children's book by an American author.

Her father, Robert Thurman, is a professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies and an author who lived as an ordained Buddhist monk for three years. Her mother, Nena von Schlebrügge, a high-fashion model, was born in Mexico City to a German nobleman and Birgit Holmquist, a Swedish model.\nThurman received a Buddhist upbringing, and spent altogether around two years in Almora, Uttarakhand, India. She grew up mostly in Amherst, Massachusetts, where she went to Amherst Regional Junior High School, then moved to Woodstock, New York. She has three brothers, Ganden (b. 1967), Dechen Karl (b. 1973), and Mipam (b. 1978), and a half-sister named Taya (b. 1961), from her father's previous marriage. Thurman's first cousin once removed is Swedish soccer player Max von Schlebrügge.\nShe is described, in a 2004 biography, as having been an awkward and introverted girl who was teased for her appearance and unusual name (sometimes using the name \"Uma Karen\" instead of her birth name). When Thurman was ten years old, a friend's mother suggested a nose job. As a child, she suffered bouts of body dysmorphic disorder. She attended Amherst Public Schools, where in eighth grade she discovered her love of acting. At age 14, she attended Northfield Mount Hermon School, a preparatory school in Massachusetts, where talent scouts noticed her performance as Abigail in a production of The Crucible and offered her the chance to act professionally; she then dropped out to pursue an acting career.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Modeling and acting beginnings (1985–1989) ===\nThurman began her career as a fashion model at age 15, and signed with the agency Click Models. Her early modeling credits included Glamour and the December 1985 and May 1986 covers of British Vogue. She made the transition to acting with her film debut, the teen thriller Kiss Daddy Goodnight, which was released in 1987. Thurman was subsequently cast in three 1988 films — Johnny Be Good, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and most notably, Dangerous Liaisons. In the comedy Johnny Be Good, she played the girlfriend of a top high school quarterback prospect, and in The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, she made a brief appearance as the goddess Venus; during her entrance she briefly appears nude, in an homage to Botticelli's The Birth of Venus.\nIn the Oscar-winning drama Dangerous Liaisons, co-starring Glenn Close and John Malkovich, Thurman took on the role of a naive teenager, seduced by a manipulative man. The picture was an arthouse success, and garnered Thurman recognition from critics and audiences; film critic Roger Ebert found her to be \"well cast\" in her \"tricky\" key role. At the time, insecure about her appearance, she spent roughly a year in London, during which she often wore loose, baggy clothing. Malkovich said of her, \"There is nothing twitchy teenager-ish about her, I haven't met anyone like her at that age. Her intelligence and poise stand out. But there's something else. She's more than a little haunted.\"\n\n\n=== Early prominence and Pulp Fiction (1990–1995) ===\nIn 1990, Thurman appeared with Fred Ward and Maria de Medeiros in Henry & June, a sexually provocative drama about the relationship and affairs between writer Henry Miller and his wife June Miller in 1931 Paris. This film was the first to receive an NC-17 rating and partly because many American newspapers refused to advertise films with the new rating, it did not get wide release in the United States. However, it won Thurman good notices; The New York Times wrote: \"Thurman, as the Brooklyn-accented June, takes a larger-than-life character and makes her even bigger, though the performance is often as curious as it is commanding.\" After playing Maid Marian in the 1991 British adventure film Robin Hood, Thurman began filming Dylan Thomas, a biopic on Welsh poet Dylan Thomas starring her then-husband Gary Oldman with herself as Caitlin Thomas, however the project was shut down shortly after filming began. Thurman went on to star as the patient of a San Francisco psychiatrist in the neo-noir drama Final Analysis (1992), opposite Richard Gere and Kim Basinger, and as a blind woman romantically involved with a former policeman in the thriller Jennifer 8 (also 1992), with Andy García.\nThurman portrayed a young woman with unusually big thumbs in Gus Van Sant's 1993 adaptation of Tom Robbins' novel Even Cowgirls Get the Blues. The film was a critical and commercial failure, eventually earning Thurman a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress. The Washington Post described her acting as shallow and remarked: \"Thurman's strangely passive characterization doesn't go much deeper than drawling and flexing her prosthetic thumbs\". Also in 1993, she starred as a waitress opposite Robert De Niro and Bill Murray in the drama Mad Dog and Glory and auditioned for Stanley Kubrick while he was casting for his eventually unrealized adaptation of the novel Wartime Lies.\n\nIn Quentin Tarantino's neo-noir black comedy Pulp Fiction (1994), Thurman played Mia Wallace, the wife of a Los Angeles mobster. Several actresses were considered for the role, but Tarantino wanted Thurman after their first meeting. The film grossed $213.9 million worldwide and received widespread acclaim, appearing on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. She dominated most of the movie's promotional material; Mia is considered one of the most iconic female film characters of the 1990s. The Washington Post asserted that Thurman was \"serenely unrecognizable in a black wig, [and] is marvelous as a zoned-out gangster's girlfriend\". For her performance, Thurman was nominated for the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and launched into the celebrity A-list. She took little advantage of her new-found fame by choosing not to do any big-budget films for the next three years. In a 2003 interview with Time magazine, Tarantino, who considers Thurman his muse, remarked that she was \"up there with Garbo and Dietrich in goddess territory\".\n\n\n=== Established career (1996–2002) ===\nThurman's next films, the romantic dramedy Beautiful Girls, in which she played a fairly wise love interest, and the comedy The Truth About Cats & Dogs, in which she top-billed as a ditzy blonde model, were modest commercial successes amid a positive critical response upon their theatrical releases in 1996. In 1997, Thurman starred opposite Ethan Hawke in Gattaca, a science fiction film set in a future society driven by eugenics where potential children are conceived through genetic manipulation. The film received critical praise and became successful on the home video market, despite lackluster box office receipts. Her next film role was that of supervillain Poison Ivy in Batman & Robin (1997). Budgeted at $160 million, the film grossed a modest $238 million worldwide and is often considered to be one of the worst films ever made. Thurman's performance, however, was largely highlighted upon the film's release; the Houston Chronicle remarked that \"Thurman [...] sometimes seems to be doing Mae West by way of Jessica Rabbit\", and a similar comparison was made by The New York Times: \"[L]ike Mae West, she mixes true femininity with the winking womanliness of a drag queen\". She obtained a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Best Sci-fi Actress and was also nominated for Favourite Movie Actress at the Kids' Choice Awards.\nThurman took on the role of Fantine in Les Misérables, the 1998 film version of Victor Hugo's novel of the same name, directed by Bille August. The film was considered an \"intelligent, handsomely crafted adaptation\" of the classic novel, according to Rotten Tomatoes, and on his review of the film, Roger Ebert expressed that \"Thurman's performance is the best element\" of the story. That year, she also starred as a British secret agent in The Avengers, a notable financial and critical flop; CNN described her as \"so distanced you feel like you're watching her through the wrong end of a telescope\". In 1999, she performed in theater in an update of Molière's The Misanthrope at the Classic Stage Company, and portrayed a socialite in Woody Allen's romantic dramedy Sweet and Lowdown, opposite Sean Penn. Thurman was in a hiatus from acting at the time as she had her daughter in 1998, doing only a few small, low-budget projects after giving birth; she eventually turned down the role of Éowyn in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, which she considers \"one of the worst decisions [she] ever made\".\n\nThurman headlined the period drama The Golden Bowl (2000), based on the 1904 novel of the same name by Henry James. In November 2000, she narrated the John Moran opera Book of the Dead (2nd Avenue) at The Public Theater. The historical drama Vatel (2000) saw Thurman play Anne de Montausier, the love interest of 17th-century French chef François Vatel, and in Richard Linklater's real-time drama Tape (2001), she starred as the former girlfriend of a drug dealer and volunteer firefighter (Ethan Hawke). She was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female for her part in Tape. Hawke directed her in Chelsea Walls (2001), a drama revolving a number of artists as they spend a single day in New York's famed bohemian home Chelsea Hotel. Thurman would win a Golden Globe for her performance in the HBO cable film Hysterical Blindness (2002), where she was also one of the executive producers. Thurman played a New Jersey woman in the 1980s searching for romance. In its review, the San Francisco Chronicle remarked: \"Thurman so commits herself to the role, eyes blazing and body akimbo, that you start to believe that such a creature could exist—an exquisite-looking woman so spastic and needy that she repulses regular Joes. Thurman has bent the role to her will.\"\n\n\n=== Renewed success with Kill Bill (2003–2005) ===\nThurman reunited with Quentin Tarantino for the two-part martial arts action film Kill Bill (2003–2004), portraying assassin Beatrix Kiddo, out for revenge against her former lover. Tarantino wrote the part specifically for her. He cited Thurman as his muse while writing the film, and gave her joint credit for the character, whom the two conceived on the set of Pulp Fiction from the sole image of a bride covered in blood. Thurman's main inspiration for the role was the title character of Coffy (played by Pam Grier) and the character of Gloria Swenson from Gloria (played by Gena Rowlands). She said that both of them are \"two of the only women I've ever seen be truly women [while] holding a weapon\". Production was delayed for several months after Thurman became pregnant and Tarantino refused to recast the part. The film took nine months to shoot, and was filmed in five different countries. The role was also her most demanding, and she spent three months training in martial arts, swordsmanship, and Japanese. Kill Bill was originally set to be released as one film, however, due to its long running time, it was ultimately released in two parts. Both volumes scored highly with critics and audiences, subsequently developing a cult following. Rolling Stone likened Thurman to \"an avenging angel out of a 1940s Hollywood melodrama\". She was nominated for two Golden Globes for both entries, plus three MTV Movie Awards for Best Female Performance and two for Best Fight.\nBy 2005, Thurman had a reported asking price of $12.5 million per film. Besides the children's film The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie, in which Thurman had a cameo, she had three other major film releases throughout 2005. Her first film in the year was the crime-comedy Be Cool, the sequel to 1995's Get Shorty, which reunited her with her Pulp Fiction co-star John Travolta. Despite a lukewarm critical reception, the film grossed $95 million. She next starred in the romantic comedy Prime with Meryl Streep, playing a divorced and lonesome business-woman who enters a relationship with a much younger man (Bryan Greenberg). A modest mainstream success, it eventually grossed $67.9 million internationally. In the remake The Producers (her last 2005 film), Thurman played Ulla, a Swedish stage actress hoping to win a part in a new Broadway musical. She is credited for her songs in the film. While box office receipts were modest, Thurman garnered acclaim from critics; A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated: \"Thurman as a would-be actress is the one bit of genuine radiance in this aggressively and pointlessly shiny, noisy spectacle.\"\n\n\n=== Commercial fluctuations (2006–2011) ===\nIn 2006, Thurman starred opposite Luke Wilson in My Super Ex-Girlfriend, playing a superhero who is dumped by her boyfriend and then takes her revenge upon him. She received $14 million for the role, but the film was panned by critics and made a modest $61 million worldwide. Entertainment Weekly wrote that it was a \"miscalculation to make Thurman the antagonist. She does a sprightly satiric turn, but [it is] wasted in a movie that would rather tweak male paranoia than liberate a nerdette terrified of her powers\". In the 2007 film The Life Before Her Eyes, Thurman starred as an accident survivor whose guilt causes her present-day life to fall apart. It received a limited theatrical release and was dismissed by critics as \"a confusing, painfully overwrought melodrama\".\n\nIn 2008, Thurman starred with Colin Firth and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in The Accidental Husband, a romantic comedy where she played a woman who finds herself married while engaged to another man. Despite theatrical runs abroad, the film was released on DVD in North America due to financial problems with its distributor. She also took on the role of a cocaine addict in the British television drama My Zinc Bed, which garnered what was considered poor ratings, especially given her involvement.\nIn 2009's Motherhood, she starred as a New York City mother whose dilemmas of marriage, work, and self are shown in the trials and tribulations of one pivotal day. \"I've never really played a realistic mom before,\" she said. Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only, the independent dramedy garnered just $93,388 in three weeks of release. About Thurman's character and its place in the overall film, New York Times critic A. O. Scott wrote that \"Eliza is scattered, ambivalent, flaky and inconsistent—all of which is fine, and energetically conveyed by Ms. Thurman. But what are tolerable quirks in a person can be deadly to a narrative [...] the movie stumbles from loose and scruffy naturalism to sitcom tidiness\". Thurman filmed a brief role in the fantasy adaptation Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (2010), appearing as Medusa, a gorgon cursed by Athena.\nIn 2011, she was a member of the jury for the main competition at the Cannes Film Festival, and her only film in the year—Ceremony—was released for VOD and selected theaters after its initial screening at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. In the independent comedy, she starred as woman on the eve of her wedding who re-connects with an old fling (played by Michael Angarano). By that time, she had taken on the roles of a powerful and wealthy mistress in the period drama Bel Ami (2012), a trophy wife in the romantic comedy Playing for Keeps (2012), and that of Lois Lane in a segment of the anthology film Movie 43 (2013); all films were panned by critics and flopped at the box office. Writing for the New York Daily News in her review for Ceremony, Elizabeth Weitzman noted: \"She gets stuck in so many small, undeserving projects, one has to wonder who's mapping out her career\".\n\n\n=== Transition to television and Broadway debut (2012–2018) ===\nThurman ventured into television in 2012, when she joined the cast of the drama series Smash in its first season, portraying the five-episode role of Rebecca Duvall, a Hollywood actress who wants to star in a new Broadway musical, despite having limited musical ability. Her performance garnered critical acclaim, with The A.V. Club writing: \"Uma Thurman is a lot of fun. She gives that character some pop, playing both the shallow, demanding side of celebrity [...] and the sincere, talented side [...]\". She earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.\n\nThurman appeared in the Volume I of Lars von Trier's two-part ensemble art drama Nymphomaniac (2013) as Mrs. H, a rejected wife who confronts her estranged husband. Despite her limited screen time in the film, Rolling Stone remarked that she was \"sensational\" in a role that defies \"[von Trier]'s mixed feelings about female power\", while Vanity Fair found her to be \"downright terrific\", noting that she \"lends the character [...] a good deal of dignity\". For her part, she received a Bodil Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and in 2014, she won the BAMBI Award for Best International Actress.\nIn 2015, Thurman starred on the NBC miniseries The Slap, the American adaptation of the Australian series of the same name about the fallout after a man slaps another couple's misbehaving child, and played a famed restaurant critic named Simone in the drama Burnt, starring Bradley Cooper. In 2017, Thurman took on the recurring role of a fixer on the Bravo dark comedy series Imposters, which ran for two seasons, and was named president of Cannes Film Festival \"Un Certain Regard\" jury for \"works which offer a unique perspective and aesthetic\".\nThurman made her Broadway debut in The Parisian Woman, a play written by Beau Willimon. Set in Washington, D.C., the production saw her star as a socialite coming to terms with politics, her past, her marriage and an uncertain future. The play ran for 141 performances, including previews, between November 2017 and March 2018, garnering a mixed critical response and what was described as \"strong\" box-office returns by Playbill. The New York Times remarked: \"Unlike many actors whose expertise derives from movies, [Thurman] has no trouble fully inhabiting, and projecting, even a jury-rigged character like [hers]. Her intelligence and, it has to be said, her innate glamour, make it possible to care about someone you do not believe in\". For her role, she won the Broadway.com Audience Award for Favorite Leading Actress in a Play.\nThe Con Is On, an independent heist comedy Thurman filmed in 2015, opposite Tim Roth, was released on May 4, 2018.  Both actors played a con-artist couple planning a jewel heist in Los Angeles, after escaping from a notorious Russian gangster. She reunited with director Lars von Trier to play the first victim of a serial killer during the 1980s in his psychological horror film The House That Jack Built, which premiered on May 14, 2018, at the Cannes Film Festival. In her next film, the supernatural thriller Down a Dark Hall (2018), directed by Rodrigo Cortés, Uma portrayed the role of Madame Duret, the eccentric headmistress of a mysterious school for troubled girls. In its review for the latter film, Variety noted that she \"cuts an elegant figure [...] but her somewhat unconvincing villain could have used more notes of mystery and wit\".\n\n\n=== Television and film roles (2019–present) ===\nThurman played a grieving mother in the Netflix supernatural horror series Chambers, which was released on April 26, 2019. Alex McLevy, writing for The A.V. Club, remarked that she \"[sold] the hell out of [her] often absurd role\", which he found to be \"over-written\", as part of an overall mixed response. In 2019, Thurman also received a career honorary award at the David di Donatello Film Awards in Italy, and performed the role of Helene Alving in a revival of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts at the Williamstown Theatre Festival.\nThurman reunited with Robert De Niro, her co-star in Mad Dog and Glory, for the family comedy The War with Grandpa, in which she portrayed the daughter of his recently widowed character. Originally filmed in May 2017, the film had a lengthy post-production due to the closure of The Weinstein Company, the original distributor, but was eventually released theatrically in North America on October 9, 2020, by 101 Studios. Despite negative reviews, The War with Grandpa made US$40 million worldwide, which was deemed a success amid the COVID-19 pandemic. She served as the narrator of The Age of Nature, a three-part documentary series, which aired on PBS in October 2020.\nThe Apple TV+ thriller series Suspicion, which premiered on February 4, 2022, featured Thurman as an American media mogul whose son is kidnapped. The production received mixed reviews from critics, who collectively noted that she \"was barely in it at all\", despite being heavily promoted. She next portrayed Arianna Huffington, the co-founder of The Huffington Post, in The Battle For Uber, the first season of Super Pumped, an anthology drama television series created by Brian Koppelman and David Levien, which debuted on Showtime on February 27, 2022. While Brian Lowry of CNN praised Thurman's efforts at a Greek accent, Adrian Horton of The Guardian described her portrayal as \"a cringey caricature\" of Huffington. Thurman appeared as  Roxanne Martel in the coming-of-age film   Hollywood Stargirl, which was released on June 3, 2022, on Disney+.\nIn 2023, Thurman starred as an art dealer in the crime thriller The Kill Room, alongside Pulp Fiction collaborator Samuel L. Jackson, and as fictional US president Ellen Claremont in the Amazon Prime romantic comedy Red, White & Royal Blue. She also joined the cast of the sequel to The Old Guard, alongside Charlize Theron. The Old Guard 2 was released in 2025.\n\n\n== Public image ==\n\n\n=== General ===\n\nEmpire included Thurman among \"The 100 Sexiest Stars in Film History\" in 1995 as well as \"The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time\" in 1997. A regular feature on FHM's \"100 Sexiest Women in the World\" from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, she also ranked at No. 34, No. 21 and No. 30 on the Maxim Hot 100 in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively. In 2013, Thurman was named one of the \"100 Hottest Women of the 21st Century\" by GQ.\nOn February 7, 2006, Thurman was awarded and named a knight of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France for outstanding achievement in the field of art and literature, and for her work and importance as an actress.\nThe American rock band Fall Out Boy released a song titled \"Uma Thurman\" in 2015, celebrating the actress and her roles in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. She gave permission for the band to use her name, and during an interview on the Today Show, stated: \"It's very, like unbelievably polite and gracious of them. So sweet. I'm so happy for their big success\".\nIn 2020, scientists named a new species of fringe-toed lizard from southwest Arizona (Uma thurmanae) after Thurman.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nThe lavender Prada dress Thurman wore to the 67th Academy Awards on March 27, 1995, was admired by the media. Stylecaster.com stated that, as a result, \"Thurman became known for her stellar fashion sense, while Prada got a huge boost from instant name recognition the world over.\" Similarly, her crimson Alberta Ferretti dress at the 72nd Academy Awards on March 26, 2000, remains among her most notable, with The Daily Telegraph voting it the 20th greatest red carpet gown of all time. Thurman has been a face and spokeswoman of Lancôme, TAG Heuer, Louis Vuitton, and Parfums Givenchy. She posed for the 2014 Campari Calendar and was among the actresses photographed by Peter Lindbergh for the 2017 Pirelli Calendar.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Relationships ===\nThurman met English actor Gary Oldman on the set of State of Grace; they married in 1990 and divorced in 1992. On May 1, 1998, she married American actor Ethan Hawke, whom she met on the set of the 1997 film Gattaca. Hawke's novel Ash Wednesday is dedicated to \"Karuna\", Thurman's middle name. Together, Thurman and Hawke have two children, a daughter, Maya (born in 1998), and a son, Levon (born in 2002). The couple separated in 2003, and the divorce was finalized in August 2005.\nThurman was engaged to American businessman and hotelier André Balazs from 2003 to 2007 but they never married. They briefly rekindled their relationship from 2014 to 2015. Thurman began dating London-based French financier Arpad Busson in 2007, and they announced their engagement in June 2008. In late 2009, they called off their engagement, but reconciled soon after. The couple called off the engagement for the second time in April 2014. Thurman and Busson have a daughter, Luna Thurman-Busson, born in July 2012. In January 2017, Thurman and Busson began child custody negotiations in relation to their daughter, which resulted in Thurman receiving primary physical custody later that month.\nShe dated architect Peter Sabbeth in 2020. As of 2021, she was dating American media executive Justin B. Smith.\n\n\n=== Stalking incidents and sexual assaults ===\nThurman was the target of a stalker, Jack Jordan, from about 2004 to 2011. He was arrested in October 2007 and, following a trial in which Thurman testified as a witness, was convicted of stalking and harassment charges the following May. Sentenced to three years' probation, Jordan was arrested again in 2010 on charges of violating a restraining order by attempting to contact her. He pleaded guilty in November 2011 after spending 11 months in jail in lieu of bail, and was released with time served.\nIn 2017, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, Thurman was interviewed, and, when asked about the scandal, she replied, \"no comment,\" stating she was too angry to talk about the case. A few weeks later, through an Instagram post, she joined the \"Me Too\" hashtag, confirming that she had suffered sexual harassment and expressing disgust for Harvey Weinstein. In a 2018 interview with The New York Times, Thurman revealed that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her in 1994 at the Savoy Hotel in London. She also revealed that she had been sexually assaulted at age 16 by an actor nearly 20 years her senior.\n\n\n=== Kill Bill car crash ===\nIn the same 2018 New York Times interview, Thurman described how she had been in a serious car accident back in 2003 on the set of Kill Bill, because Tarantino had insisted she perform her own driving stunts. Two weeks after the crash, she tried to see footage of the incident. Thurman stated that Miramax would only agree to show her the footage if she signed a contract \"releasing them of any consequences of my future pain and suffering\", which she refused. As a result of the crash, she sustained permanent injuries to her neck and knees. Tarantino later called this incident \"the biggest regret of [his] life\". Thurman later clarified on Instagram that Tarantino had apologized to her for the incident and that she has since forgiven him, being open to working with him again.\n\n\n=== Activism and politics ===\nThurman has been involved in various philanthropic and activist causes. She is a supporter of the Democratic Party, and has given money to the campaigns of John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, and Joseph R. Driscoll. She supports gun control, and in 2000 participated in Marie Claire's \"End Gun Violence Now\" campaign. She is a member of the board of Room to Grow, a charitable organization providing aid to families and children suffering poverty. She serves on the board of the Tibet House US. In 2007, she hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, with actor Kevin Spacey.\nIn February 2008, ahead of that year's Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Thurman talked about human rights in China alongside Steven Spielberg and others.\nIn 2011, Thurman was one of several celebrities associated with the USAID and Ad Council's FWD campaign, an awareness initiative tied to that year's East Africa drought. She joined Geena Davis, Chanel Iman and Josh Hartnett in TV and internet ads to \"forward the facts\" about the crisis. During the same year, she also participated at Human Rights Campaign for LGBT civil rights, saying \"We're fighting for a conservative value: the right to make a lifelong commitment to someone you love\". In 2015, Thurman joined \"Rhino Rescue Project\" and traveled to Southern Africa to assist and help relocate the threatened species of black rhinoceros; being in close contact with rhinos, Thurman defined her experience with those animals to be \"spiritual, surreal\".\nThurman was critical of the Texas Heartbeat Act, an abortion ban that went into effect in September 2021. She called the law a \"human rights crisis for American women\", and discussed her experience of obtaining an abortion in her teens after she had been \"accidentally impregnated by a much older man.\" She described her abortion as \"the hardest decision of my life,\" but maintained that it \"allowed me to grow up and become the mother I wanted and needed to be.\"\n\n\n== Acting credits and awards ==\n\nThurman has starred in over 50 films. According to review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes and infotainment website Screen Rant, her most critically acclaimed and commercial successful films include Pulp Fiction (1994), Dangerous Liaisons (1988), Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003), Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004), Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), The Truth About Cats & Dogs (1996), Gattaca (1997), Beautiful Girls (1996), Mad Dog and Glory (1993), Sweet and Lowdown (1999), Tape (2001), Les Miserables (1998), and A Month by the Lake (1995).\nThurman's performance in Pulp Fiction earned nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a SAG-AFTRA's Actor Award.

{"provider": "wikipedia", "id": "13492", "title": "Hyperthyroidism", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism", "content_length": 33335, "text": "Hyperthyroidism is a endocrine disease in which the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones. Thyrotoxicosis is a condition that occurs due to elevated levels of thyroid hormones of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism. Some, however, use the terms interchangeably. Signs and symptoms vary between people and may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, heat intolerance, diarrhea, enlargement of the thyroid, hand tremor, and weight loss. Symptoms are typically less severe in the elderly and during pregnancy. An uncommon but life-threatening complication is thyroid storm in which an event such as an infection results in worsening symptoms such as confusion and a high temperature; this often results in death. The opposite is hypothyroidism, when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone.\nGraves' disease is the cause of about 50% to 80% of the cases of hyperthyroidism in the United States. Other causes include multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, inflammation of the thyroid, eating too much iodine, and too much synthetic thyroid hormone. A less common cause is a pituitary adenoma. The diagnosis may be suspected based on signs and symptoms and then confirmed with blood tests. Typically blood tests show a low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and raised T3 or T4. Radioiodine uptake by the thyroid, thyroid scan, and measurement of antithyroid autoantibodies (thyroidal thyrotropin receptor antibodies are positive in Graves' disease)  may help determine the cause.\nTreatment depends partly on the cause and severity of the disease. There are three main treatment options: radioiodine therapy, medications, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy involves taking iodine-131 by mouth, which is then concentrated in and destroys the thyroid over weeks to months. The resulting hypothyroidism is treated with synthetic thyroid hormone. Medications such as beta blockers may control the symptoms, and anti-thyroid medications such as methimazole may temporarily help people while other treatments are having an effect. Surgery to remove the thyroid is another option. This may be used in those with very large thyroids or when cancer is a concern. In the United States, hyperthyroidism affects about 1.2% of the population. Worldwide, hyperthyroidism affects 2.5% of adults. It occurs between two and ten times more often in women. Onset is commonly between 20 and 50 years of age. Overall, the disease is more common in those over the age of 60 years.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nHyperthyroidism may be asymptomatic or present with significant symptoms. Some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism include nervousness, irritability, increased perspiration, heart racing, hand tremors, anxiety, trouble sleeping, thinning of the skin, fine brittle hair, and muscular weakness—especially in the upper arms and thighs. More frequent bowel movements may occur, and diarrhea is common. Weight loss, sometimes significant, may occur despite a good appetite (though 10% of people with a hyperactive thyroid experience weight gain), vomiting may occur, and, for women, menstrual flow may lighten and menstrual periods may occur less often, or with longer cycles than usual.\n\nThe thyroid hormone is critical to the normal function of cells. In excess, it both overstimulates metabolism and disrupts the normal functioning of sympathetic nervous system, causing speeding up of various body systems and symptoms resembling an overdose of epinephrine (adrenaline). These include fast heartbeat and symptoms of palpitations, nervous system tremor such as of the hands and anxiety symptoms, digestive system hypermotility, unintended weight loss, and, in lipid panel blood tests, a lower and sometimes unusually low serum cholesterol.\nMajor clinical signs of hyperthyroidism include weight loss (often accompanied by an increased appetite), anxiety, heat intolerance, hair loss, muscle aches, weakness, fatigue, hyperactivity, irritability, high blood sugar, excessive urination, excessive thirst, delirium, tremor, pretibial myxedema (in Graves' disease), emotional lability, and sweating.  Panic attacks, inability to concentrate, and memory problems may also occur. Psychosis and paranoia, common during thyroid storm, are rare with milder hyperthyroidism. Many persons will experience complete remission of symptoms 1 to 2 months after a euthyroid state is obtained, with a marked reduction in anxiety, sense of exhaustion, irritability, and depression. Some individuals may have an increased rate of anxiety or persistence of affective and cognitive symptoms for several months to up to 10 years after a euthyroid state is established. In addition, those with hyperthyroidism may present with a variety of physical symptoms such as palpitations and abnormal heart rhythms (the notable ones being atrial fibrillation), shortness of breath (dyspnea), loss of libido, amenorrhea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gynecomastia and feminization. Long term untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to osteoporosis. These classical symptoms may not be present often in the elderly.\nBone loss, which is associated with overt but not subclinical hyperthyroidism, may occur in 10 to 20% of patients. This may be due to an increase in bone remodelling and a decrease in bone density, which increases fracture risk. It is more common in postmenopausal women; less so in younger women and men. Bone disease related to hyperthyroidism was first described by Frederick von Recklinghausen, in 1891; he described the bones of a woman who died of hyperthyroidism as appearing \"worm-eaten\".\n\nNeurological manifestations can include tremors, chorea, myopathy, and in some susceptible individuals (in particular of Asian descent) periodic paralysis. An association between thyroid disease and myasthenia gravis has been recognized. Thyroid disease, in this condition, is autoimmune in nature, and approximately 5% of people with myasthenia gravis also have hyperthyroidism. Myasthenia gravis rarely improves after thyroid treatment and the relationship between the two entities is becoming better understood over the past 15 years.In Graves' disease, ophthalmopathy may cause the eyes to look enlarged because the eye muscles swell and push the eye forward. Sometimes, one or both eyes may bulge. Some have swelling of the front of the neck from an enlarged thyroid gland (a goiter).\nMinor ocular (eye) signs, which may be present in any type of hyperthyroidism, are eyelid retraction (\"stare\"), extraocular muscle weakness, and lid-lag. In hyperthyroid stare (Dalrymple sign) the eyelids are retracted upward more than normal (the normal position is at the superior corneoscleral limbus, where the \"white\" of the eye begins at the upper border of the iris). Extraocular muscle weakness may present with double vision. In lid-lag (von Graefe's sign), when the person tracks an object downward with their eyes, the eyelid fails to follow the downward-moving iris, and the same type of upper globe exposure which is seen with lid retraction occurs, temporarily. These signs disappear with treatment of the hyperthyroidism.\nNeither of these ocular signs should be confused with exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeball), which occurs specifically and uniquely in hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease (note that not all exophthalmos is caused by Graves' disease, but when present with hyperthyroidism is diagnostic of Graves' disease). This forward protrusion of the eyes is due to immune-mediated inflammation in the retro-orbital (eye socket) fat. Exophthalmos, when present, may exacerbate hyperthyroid lid-lag and stare.\n\n\n=== Thyroid storm ===\n\nThyroid storm is a severe form of thyrotoxicosis characterized by rapid and often irregular heartbeat, high temperature, vomiting, diarrhea, and mental agitation. Symptoms may not be typical in the young, old, or pregnant. It usually occurs due to untreated hyperthyroidism and can be provoked by infections. It is a medical emergency and requires hospital care to control the symptoms rapidly. The mortality rate in thyroid storm is 3.6-17%, usually due to multi-organ system failure.\n\n\n=== Hypothyroidism ===\nHyperthyroidism due to certain types of thyroiditis can eventually lead to hypothyroidism (a lack of thyroid hormone), as the thyroid gland is damaged. Also, radioiodine treatment of Graves' disease often eventually leads to hypothyroidism. Such hypothyroidism may be diagnosed with thyroid hormone testing and treated by oral thyroid hormone supplementation.\n\n\n== Causes ==\n\nThere are several causes of hyperthyroidism. Most often, the entire gland is overproducing thyroid hormone. Less commonly, a single nodule is responsible for the excess hormone secretion, called a \"hot\" nodule. Thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid) can also cause hyperthyroidism. Functional thyroid tissue producing an excess of thyroid hormone occurs in a number of clinical conditions.\nThe major causes in humans are:\n\nGraves' disease. An autoimmune disease (usually, the most common cause with 50–80% worldwide, although this varies substantially with location- i.e., 47% in Switzerland (Horst et al., 1987) to 90% in the USA (Hamburger et al. 1981)). Thought to be due to varying levels of iodine in the diet. It is eight times more common in females than males and often occurs in young females, around 20 to 40 years of age.\nToxic thyroid adenoma (the most common cause in Switzerland, 53%, thought to be atypical due to a low level of dietary iodine in this country)\nToxic multinodular goiter\nHigh blood levels of thyroid hormones (most accurately termed hyperthyroxinemia) can occur for several other reasons:\n\nInflammation of the thyroid is called thyroiditis. There are several different kinds of thyroiditis, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hypothyroidism immune-mediated), and subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain's). These may be initially associated with secretion of excess thyroid hormone but usually progress to gland dysfunction and, thus, to hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism.\nOral consumption of excess thyroid hormone tablets is possible (surreptitious use of thyroid hormone), as is the rare event of eating ground beef or pork contaminated with thyroid tissue, and thus thyroid hormones (termed hamburger thyrotoxicosis or alimentary thyrotoxicosis). Pharmacy compounding errors may also be a cause.\nAmiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug, is structurally similar to thyroxine and may cause either under-or overactivity of the thyroid.\nPostpartum thyroiditis (PPT) occurs in about 7% of women during the year after they give birth. PPT typically has several phases, the first of which is hyperthyroidism. This form of hyperthyroidism usually corrects itself within weeks or months without the need for treatment.\nA struma ovarii is a rare form of monodermal teratoma that contains mostly thyroid tissue, which leads to hyperthyroidism.\nExcess iodine consumption, notably from algae such as kelp.\nThyrotoxicosis can also occur after taking too much thyroid hormone in the form of supplements, such as levothyroxine (a phenomenon known as exogenous thyrotoxicosis, alimentary thyrotoxicosis, or occult factitial thyrotoxicosis).\nHypersecretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn is almost always caused by a pituitary adenoma, accounts for much less than 1 percent of hyperthyroidism cases.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nMeasuring the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), produced by the pituitary gland (which in turn is also regulated by the hypothalamus's TSH-Releasing Hormone) in the blood, is typically the initial test for suspected hyperthyroidism. A low TSH level typically indicates that the pituitary gland is being inhibited or \"instructed\" by the brain to cut back on stimulating the thyroid gland, having sensed increased levels of T4 and/or T3 in the blood. In rare circumstances, a low TSH indicates primary failure of the pituitary, or temporary inhibition of the pituitary due to another illness (euthyroid sick syndrome) and so checking the T4 and T3 is still clinically useful.\nMeasuring specific antibodies, such as anti-TSH-receptor antibodies in Graves' disease, or anti-thyroid peroxidase in Hashimoto's thyroiditis—a common cause of hypothyroidism—may also contribute to the diagnosis. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is confirmed by blood tests that show a decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and elevated T4 and T3 levels. TSH is a hormone made by the pituitary gland in the brain that tells the thyroid gland how much hormone to make. When there is too much thyroid hormone, the TSH will be low. A radioactive iodine uptake test and thyroid scan together characterize or enable radiologists and doctors to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism. The uptake test uses radioactive iodine injected or taken orally on an empty stomach to measure the amount of iodine absorbed by the thyroid gland. People with hyperthyroidism absorb much more iodine than healthy people, including radioactive iodine, which is easy to measure.  A thyroid scan producing images is typically conducted in connection with the uptake test to allow visual examination of the over-functioning gland.\nThyroid scintigraphy is a useful test to characterize (distinguish between causes of) hyperthyroidism, and this entity from thyroiditis. This test procedure typically involves two tests performed in connection with each other: an iodine uptake test and a scan (imaging) with a gamma camera. The uptake test involves administering a dose of radioactive iodine (radioiodine), traditionally iodine-131 (131I), and more recently iodine-123 (123I). Iodine-123 may be the preferred radionuclide in some clinics due to its more favorable radiation dosimetry (i.e., less radiation dose to the person per unit administered radioactivity) and a gamma photon energy more amenable to imaging with the gamma camera. For the imaging scan, I-123 is considered an almost ideal isotope of iodine for imaging thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer metastasis. Thyroid scintigraphy should not be performed in those who are pregnant, a thyroid ultrasound with color flow doppler may be obtained as an alternative in these circumstances.\nTypical administration involves a pill or liquid containing sodium iodide (NaI) taken orally, which contains a small amount of iodine-131, amounting to perhaps less than a grain of salt. A 2-hour fast of no food prior to and for 1 hour after ingesting the pill is required. This low dose of radioiodine is typically tolerated by individuals otherwise allergic to iodine (such as those unable to tolerate contrast mediums containing larger doses of iodine such as used in CT scan, intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and similar imaging diagnostic procedures). Excess radioiodine that does not get absorbed into the thyroid gland is eliminated by the body in urine. Some people with hyperthyroidism may experience a slight allergic reaction to the diagnostic radioiodine and may be given an antihistamine.\nThe person returns 24 hours later to have the level of radioiodine \"uptake\" (absorbed by the thyroid gland) measured by a device with a metal bar placed against the neck, which measures the radioactivity emitted from the thyroid. This test takes about 4 minutes while the uptake % (i.e., percentage) is accumulated (calculated) by the machine software. A scan is also performed, wherein images (typically a center, left, and right angle) are taken of the contrasted thyroid gland with a gamma camera; a radiologist will read and prepare a report indicating the uptake % and comments after examining the images. People with hyperthyroidism will typically \"take up\" higher-than-normal levels of radioiodine. Normal ranges for RAI uptake are from 10 to 30%.\nIn addition to testing the TSH levels, many doctors test for T3, Free T3, T4, and/or Free T4 for more detailed results. Free T4 is unbound to any protein in the blood. Adult limits for these hormones are: TSH (units): 0.45 – 4.50 uIU/mL; T4 Free/Direct (nanograms): 0.82 – 1.77 ng/dl; and T3 (nanograms): 71 – 180 ng/dl. Persons with hyperthyroidism can easily exhibit levels many times these upper limits for T4 and/or T3. See a complete table of normal range limits for thyroid function at the thyroid gland article.\nIn hyperthyroidism, CK-MB (Creatine kinase) is usually elevated.\n\n\n=== Subclinical ===\n\nIn overt primary hyperthyroidism, TSH levels are low, and T4 and T3 levels are high. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a milder form of hyperthyroidism characterized by low or undetectable serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. Although the evidence for doing so is not definitive, treatment of elderly persons having subclinical hyperthyroidism could reduce the number of cases of atrial fibrillation. There is also an increased risk of bone fractures (by 42%) in people with subclinical hyperthyroidism; there is insufficient evidence to say whether treatment with antithyroid medications would reduce that risk.\nA 2022 meta-analysis found subclinical hyperthyroidism to be associated with cardiovascular death.\n\n\n=== Screening ===\nIn those without symptoms who are not pregnant, there is little evidence for or against screening.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\n\n\n=== Antithyroid drugs ===\nThyrostatics (antithyroid drugs) are drugs that inhibit the production of thyroid hormones, such as carbimazole (used in the UK) and methimazole (used in the US, Germany, and Russia), and propylthiouracil. Thyrostatics are believed to work by inhibiting the iodination of thyroglobulin by thyroperoxidase and, thus, the formation of tetraiodothyronine (T4). Propylthiouracil also works outside the thyroid gland, preventing the conversion of (mostly inactive) T4 to the active form T3. Because thyroid tissue usually contains a substantial reserve of thyroid hormone, thyrostatics can take weeks to become effective, and the dose often needs to be carefully titrated over a period of months, with regular doctor visits and blood tests to monitor results.\n\n\n=== Beta-blockers ===\nMany of the common symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, trembling, and anxiety, are mediated by increases in beta-adrenergic receptors on cell surfaces. Beta blockers, typically used to treat high blood pressure, are a class of drugs that offset this effect, reducing rapid pulse associated with the sensation of palpitations, and decreasing tremor and anxiety. Thus, a person with hyperthyroidism can often obtain immediate temporary relief until the hyperthyroidism can be characterized with the Radioiodine test noted above, and more permanent treatment takes place. Note that these drugs do not treat hyperthyroidism or any of its long-term effects if left untreated, but rather, they treat or reduce only symptoms of the condition.\nSome minimal effect on thyroid hormone production, however, also comes with propranolol, which has two roles in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, determined by the different isomers of propranolol. L-propranolol causes beta-blockade, thus treating the symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism, such as tremor, palpitations, anxiety, and heat intolerance. D-propranolol inhibits thyroxine deiodinase, thereby blocking the conversion of T4 to T3, providing some, though minimal, therapeutic effect. Other beta-blockers are used to treat only the symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism. Propranolol in the UK, and metoprolol in the US, are most frequently used to augment treatment for people with hyperthyroid.\n\n\n=== Diet ===\nPeople with autoimmune hyperthyroidism (such as in Graves' disease) should not eat foods high in iodine, such as edible seaweed and seafood.\nFrom a public health perspective, the general introduction of iodized salt in the United States in 1924 resulted in lower disease, goiters, as well as improving the lives of children whose mothers would not have eaten enough iodine during pregnancy, which would have lowered the IQs of their children.\n\n\n=== Surgery ===\nSurgery (thyroidectomy to remove the whole thyroid or a part of it) is not extensively used because most common forms of hyperthyroidism are quite effectively treated by the radioactive iodine method, and because there is a risk of also removing the parathyroid glands, and of cutting the recurrent laryngeal nerve, making swallowing difficult, and even simply generalized staphylococcal infection as with any major surgery. Some people with Graves' may opt for surgical intervention. This includes those who cannot tolerate medicines for one reason or another, people who are allergic to iodine, or people who refuse radioiodine.\nA 2019 systematic review concluded that the available evidence shows no difference between visually identifying the nerve or utilizing intraoperative neuroimaging during surgery, when trying to prevent injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve during thyroid surgery.\nIf people have toxic nodules, treatments typically include either the removal or injection of the nodule with alcohol.\n\n\n=== Radioiodine ===\nIn iodine-131 (radioiodine) radioisotope therapy, which was first pioneered by Dr. Saul Hertz, radioactive iodine-131 is given orally (either by pill or liquid) on a one-time basis, to severely restrict, or altogether destroy the function of a hyperactive thyroid gland. This isotope of radioactive iodine used for ablative treatment is more potent than diagnostic radioiodine (usually iodine-123 or a very low amount of iodine-131), which has a biological half-life from 8–13 hours. Iodine-131, which also emits beta particles that are far more damaging to tissues at short range, has a half-life of approximately 8 days.  People not responding sufficiently to the first dose are sometimes given an additional radioiodine treatment, at a larger dose. Iodine-131 in this treatment is picked up by the active cells in the thyroid and destroys them, rendering the thyroid gland mostly or completely inactive.\nSince iodine is picked up more readily (though not exclusively) by thyroid cells, and (more importantly) is picked up even more readily by overactive thyroid cells, the destruction is local, and there are no widespread side effects with this therapy. Radioiodine ablation has been used for over 50 years, and the only major reasons for not using it are pregnancy and breastfeeding (breast tissue also picks up and concentrates iodine). Once the thyroid function is reduced, replacement hormone therapy (levothyroxine) taken orally each day replaces the thyroid hormone that is normally produced by the body.\nThere is extensive experience, over many years, of the use of radioiodine in the treatment of thyroid overactivity, and this experience does not indicate any increased risk of thyroid cancer following treatment. However, a study from 2007 has reported an increased number of cancer cases after radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism.\nThe principal advantage of radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism is that it tends to have a much higher success rate than medications. Depending on the dose of radioiodine chosen, and the disease under treatment (Graves' vs. toxic goiter, vs. hot nodule, etc.), the success rate in achieving definitive resolution of the hyperthyroidism may vary from 75 to 100%. A major expected side-effect of radioiodine in people with Graves' disease is the development of lifelong hypothyroidism, requiring daily treatment with thyroid hormone. On occasion, some people may require more than one radioactive treatment, depending on the type of disease present, the size of the thyroid, and the initial dose administered.\nPeople with Graves' disease manifesting moderate or severe Graves' ophthalmopathy are cautioned against radioactive iodine-131 treatment, since it has been shown to exacerbate existing thyroid eye disease. People with mild or no ophthalmic symptoms can mitigate their risk with a concurrent six-week course of prednisone. The mechanisms proposed for this side effect involve a TSH receptor common to both thyrocytes and retro-orbital tissue.\nAs radioactive iodine treatment results in the destruction of thyroid tissue, there is often a transient period of several days to weeks when the symptoms of hyperthyroidism may worsen following radioactive iodine therapy. In general, this happens as a result of thyroid hormones being released into the blood following the radioactive iodine-mediated destruction of thyroid cells that contain thyroid hormone. In some people, treatment with medications such as beta blockers (propranolol, atenolol, etc.) may be useful during this period. Most people do not experience any difficulty after the radioactive iodine treatment, usually given as a small pill. On occasion, neck tenderness or a sore throat may become apparent after a few days, if moderate inflammation in the thyroid develops and produces discomfort in the neck or throat area. This is usually transient, and not associated with a fever, etc.\nIt is recommended that breastfeeding be stopped at least six weeks before radioactive iodine treatment and that it not be resumed, although it can be done in future pregnancies. It also shouldn't be done during pregnancy, and pregnancy should be put off until at least 6–12 months after treatment.\nA common outcome following radioiodine is a swing from hyperthyroidism to easily treatable hypothyroidism, which occurs in 78% of those treated for Graves' thyrotoxicosis and in 40% of those with toxic multinodular goiter or solitary toxic adenoma. Use of higher doses of radioiodine reduces the number of cases of treatment failure, with a penalty for higher response to treatment consisting mostly of higher rates of eventual hypothyroidism, which requires hormone treatment for life.\nThere is increased sensitivity to radioiodine therapy in thyroids appearing on ultrasound scans as more uniform (hypoechogenic), due to densely packed large cells, with 81% later becoming hypothyroid, compared to just 37% in those with more normal scan appearances (normoechogenic).\n\n\n=== Thyroid storm ===\nThyroid storm presents with extreme symptoms of hyperthyroidism. It is treated aggressively with resuscitation measures along with a combination of the above modalities including: intravenous beta blockers such as propranolol, followed by a thioamide such as methimazole, an iodinated radiocontrast agent or an iodine solution if the radiocontrast agent is not available, and an intravenous steroid such as hydrocortisone. Propylthiouracil is the preferred thioamide in thyroid storm as it can prevent the conversion of T4 to the more active T3 in the peripheral tissues in addition to inhibiting thyroid hormone production.\n\n\n=== Alternative medicine ===\nIn countries such as China, herbs used alone or with antithyroid medications are used to treat hyperthyroidism. Very low quality evidence suggests that traditional Chinese herbal medications may be beneficial when taken along with routine hyperthyroid medications, however, there is no reliable evidence to determine the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medications for treating hyperthyroidism.\n\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nIn the United States, hyperthyroidism affects about 1.2% of the population. About half of these cases have obvious symptoms, while the other half do not. It occurs between two and ten times more often in women. The disease is more common in those over the age of 60 years.\nSubclinical hyperthyroidism modestly increases the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.\n\n\n== History ==\nCaleb Hillier Parry first made the association between the goiter and eye protrusion in 1786; however, he did not publish his findings until 1825. In 1835, Irish doctor Robert James Graves discovered a link between the protrusion of the eyes and goiter, giving his name to the autoimmune disease now known as Graves' Disease.\n\n\n== Pregnancy ==\n\nRecognizing and evaluating hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is a diagnostic challenge. Thyroid hormones are commonly elevated during the first trimester of pregnancy as the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulates thyroid hormone production, in a condition known as gestational transient thyrotoxicosis. Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis generally abates in the second trimester as hCG levels decline and thyroid function normalizes. Hyperthyroidism can increase the risk of complications for mother and child. Such risks include pregnancy-related hypertension, pregnancy loss, low-birth weight, pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, still birth and behavioral disorders later in the child's life. Nonetheless, high maternal FT4 levels during pregnancy have been associated with impaired brain developmental outcomes of the offspring and this was independent of hCG levels.\nPropylthiouracil is the preferred antithyroid medication in the 1st trimester of pregnancy as it is less teratogenic than methimazole.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\n\n=== Cats ===\n\nHyperthyroidism is one of the most common endocrine conditions affecting older domesticated housecats. In the United States, up to 10% of cats over ten years old have hyperthyroidism. The disease has become significantly more common since the first reports of feline hyperthyroidism in the 1970s. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in cats is the presence of benign tumors called adenomas. 98% of cases are caused by the presence of an adenoma, but the reason these cats develop such tumors continues to be studied.\nThe most common presenting symptoms are: rapid weight loss, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), vomiting, diarrhea, increased consumption of fluids (polydipsia), increased appetite (polyphagia), and increased urine production (polyuria). Other symptoms include hyperactivity, possible aggression, an unkempt appearance, and large, thick claws. Heart murmurs and a gallop rhythm can develop due to secondary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  About 70% of affected cats also have enlarged thyroid glands (goiter).\nThe same three treatments used with humans are also options in treating feline hyperthyroidism (surgery, radioiodine treatment, and anti-thyroid drugs). There is also a special low iodine diet available that will control the symptoms, providing no other food is fed; Hill's y/d formula, when given exclusively, decreases T4 production by limiting the amount of iodine needed for thyroid hormone production. It is the only available commercial diet that focuses on managing feline hyperthyroidism. Medical and dietary management using methimazole and Hill's y/d cat food will give hyperthyroid cats an average of 2 years before dying due to secondary conditions such as heart and kidney failure. Drugs used to help manage the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are methimazole and carbimazole. Drug therapy is the least expensive option, even though the drug must be administered daily for the remainder of the cat's life. Carbimazole is only available as a once-daily tablet. Methimazole is available as an oral solution, a tablet, and compounded as a topical gel that is applied using a finger cot to the hairless skin inside a cat's ear. Many cat owners find this gel a good option for cats that don't like being given pills.\nRadioiodine treatment, however, is not available in all areas, as this treatment requires nuclear radiological expertise and facilities that not only board the cat, but are specially equipped to manage the cat's urine, sweat, saliva, and stool, which are radioactive for several days after the treatment, usually for a total of 3 weeks (the cat spends the first week in total isolation and the next two weeks in close confinement). In the United States, the guidelines for radiation levels vary from state to state; some states such as Massachusetts allow hospitalization for as little as two days before the animal is sent home with care instructions.\n\n\n=== Dogs ===\nHyperthyroidism is much less common in dogs compared to cats. Hyperthyroidism may be caused by a thyroid tumor. This may be a thyroid carcinoma. About 90% of carcinomas are very aggressive; they invade the surrounding tissues and metastasize (spread) to other tissues, particularly the lungs. This has a poor prognosis. Surgery to remove the tumor is often very difficult due to metastasis into arteries, the esophagus, or the windpipe. It may be possible to reduce the size of the tumor, thus relieving symptoms and allowing time for other treatments to work. About 10% of thyroid tumors are benign; these often cause few symptoms.\nIn dogs treated for hypothyroidism (lack of thyroid hormone), iatrogenic hyperthyroidism may occur as a result of an overdose of the thyroid hormone replacement medication, levothyroxine; in this case, treatment involves reducing the dose of levothyroxine. Dogs which display coprophagy, the consumption of feces, and also live in a household with a dog receiving levothyroxine treatment, may develop hyperthyroidism if they frequently eat the feces from the dog receiving levothyroxine treatment.\nHyperthyroidism may occur if a dog eats an excessive amount of thyroid gland tissue. This has occurred in dogs fed commercial dog food.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHigh-output cardiac failure\nJod-Basedow phenomenon\nHashitoxicosis\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMerck Manual article about hyperthyroidism\nHyperthyroidism at MedlinePlus", "fetched_at": "2026-02-23T10:12:16Z"}
