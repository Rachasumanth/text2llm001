TURN 10
USER: finetune qwen model to make maths tutor
ASSISTANT: I can finetune Qwen for a Math Tutor AI via your configured Kaggle provider, but I need to lock assumptions first.

Clarifications to confirm:
1) Student level: middle school, high school, or mixed?
2) Teaching style: step-by-step only, or hints-first then full solution?
3) Scope: algebra/geometry/calculus coverage?
4) Safety: should the tutor refuse direct exam cheating prompts?

Proposed execution plan:
- Prepare supervised instruction data for math tutoring behavior.
- Run Qwen LoRA-style finetune job on Kaggle T4 runtime.
- Validate on sample doubt-solving prompts and refusal behavior.
- Persist run metadata, route project to the Kaggle instance, and report artifacts.

Reply with 'approve plan' to start Kaggle finetuning now, or answer the clarifications first.
